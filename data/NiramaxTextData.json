The reason for this was that it had failed to prove inducement.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2a4002da-37f0-4a13-b860-cd489315ba5c\">The facts</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b8c25b4a-2704-48ff-a8d8-39cd651b6098\">Niramax, the insured, was in the business of waste collection and recycling. It made a claim under its policy with Zurich following a fire at its recycling premises. Zurich insured the plant and machinery whilst another insurer provided its buildings insurance. Niramax had failed to comply with a number of risk requirements imposed by the buildings insurer and because of this the buildings insurer had imposed special terms. Niramax had then failed to disclose the risk requirements and special terms to Zurich when it had renewed its policy. Zurich claimed that it was entitled to avoid the insurance policy for non-disclosure and would not have renewed the policy had it known about the undisclosed facts.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6b0da25d-fa5a-4398-952f-ad5ad52b8b5e\">The trial judge rejected the underwriter's evidence finding that Zurich could not avoid the policy because it could not prove that it had been induced to write it on the basis of the non-disclosure.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3e4d7a4e-7378-4b77-9dcf-93302b32c0b1\">Why did the court reject the underwriter's evidence?</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e90bb3a7-3c64-4740-b044-ee3c2084252c\">The underwriter provided two witness statements and was cross-examined at length at trial. The trial judge heard extensive evidence about the insurance policy, the market and Zurich's practices and attitudes. However, the underwriter was not able to show any contemporaneous notes and had only circulated draft underwriting guidelines for waste risks to his team after the loss had occurred. The judge found that on the balance of probabilities the underwriter would have offered terms for renewal partly out of a sense of fair play to the long standing assured and partly because the story of the risk requirements was nuanced.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f9b73271-fa03-4009-8d77-cf9c0ae2c66a\">Importantly, Zurich had made a mistake when it had calculated the premium for Niramax because it had not applied the rate for waste risks properly. As such, the judge held that the renewal would have been offered, but with an adjustment to the premium to correct Zurich's earlier pricing error. As the only change to the terms was to correct an error, the judge found that Zurich had not been induced to write the policy as a result of the non-disclosure.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"46a8409f-31ff-42a9-ac25-66f4f6ba367a\">The test for causation and inducement</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a9628001-e9a6-4c2b-a484-df069fb69b34\">Zurich appealed the decision, arguing that the relevant test of causation to establish inducement was a \"but for\" test, which was satisfied on the judge's findings because but for the non-disclosure, a different premium would have been charged.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"dff24d34-e0e6-4d80-b915-47d013779d16\">The Court of Appeal, however, held that for inducement to be made out, the non-disclosure must have been an \"efficient\" or \"effective\" cause of Zurich imposing different terms. It held that a \"but for\" test of causation was insufficient. It said that in many, but not all, cases, if an insurer cannot satisfy the \"but for\" test, it will also be unable to satisfy the \"efficient cause\" test.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6bf20f84-8434-4b4d-a7d8-1a9ecdb42faa\">Applying this to the facts, the Court of Appeal found that there was no inducement. Zurich's calculation of the premium only took into account three points: the amount of cover, the nature of the trade and the claims experience. The calculation did not take into account Niramax's attitude to the risk, which was what the undisclosed facts went to, except to the extent that it was reflected in the claims experience. Accordingly, the undisclosed facts were irrelevant to the rating of risk by Zurich. The non-disclosure therefore did not have any \"causative efficacy\" in the renewal being written on cheaper terms than would have occurred had the disclosure been made. The sole efficient cause of the cheaper terms was Zurich's mistake, not the non-disclosure. It was insufficient to establish that the less onerous terms would not have been imposed, but for the non-disclosure. Zurich was therefore not entitled to avoid the policy.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"574712b6-edf7-480e-bdd9-d0e5b72f0782\">When an insurer can avoid a policy for misrepresentation</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"2a196d37-fc75-4a78-a0f2-fb8963147adf\">In the second case, Jones v Zurich Insurance plc [2021] EWHC 1320 (Comm), the court found that Zurich was entitled to avoid a home insurance policy under CIDRA 2012. The reason for this was misrepresentation by the claimant.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"301ba097-bd90-49cf-b70b-55ac688eecd6\">In this case the claimant made a claim for a Rolex watch worth £190,000 under a policy underwritten by Zurich. Zurich sought to avoid the policy by reason of a failure by the claimant to disclose a previous loss when proposing cover to Zurich. In the proposal documentation, the claimant had answered \"No\" to a question about whether he had made any claims or suffered any losses in the previous five years. In fact, he had made a claim against another insurer for £15,000 for the loss of a diamond ring during that time period. Furthermore, when Zurich had sent to the claimant a \"Statement of Fact\", which included a statement about prior claims, and had made clear that it formed the basis of the quotation and had asked the claimant to confirm its accuracy as a condition of providing cover, the claimant had again failed to disclose the prior claim.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ce76cccc-ec93-4ce2-8131-2bfa522a7123\">The court found that this was a misrepresentation by the claimant who was in breach of his duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation under section 2(2) CIDRA 2012. This was a \"qualifying misrepresentation\" under section 4(1) CIDRA 2012 because Zurich had shown on the balance of probabilities that it would not have provided the insurance had the claimant disclosed the previous claim.

This was that he had been reluctant to write the policy in the first place because of the claimant's age, residence and profession, which were all taken into account when deciding whether to provide cover. He said that he had loaded the premium quote as a result, and had he known of the prior claim, that would have tipped the balance and he would have declined cover. His concerns about providing cover were evidenced by his contemporaneous notes, a transcript of a phone call with the broker and by the high premium imposed. His notes also showed that he was particularly concerned about the jewellery element of the cover. Importantly, these concerns were present even though the claimant had declared no previous claims.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ea241834-5749-4ada-a0c4-853e9a3afbed\">Zurich had not disclosed a macro-enabled version of the spreadsheet that had been used to calculate the premium.

The court said that this would have been significant had it not also had the underwriter's contemporaneous evidence.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"4acbad40-d6ff-4281-bb7a-79be6d27e133\">Why did the court allow one policy to be avoided but not the other?</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7dfb70a5-7f41-4f50-bbdc-54a0b84d13c3\">There were a number of important differences between this case and the Niramax case, which contributed to the different outcomes and are worth highlighting and which:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6cc8ef30-bc73-401e-98e9-5ff1fd439e15\">The Jones case concerned a new client for both Zurich and the broker, whereas in the Niramax case, Niramax was a long standing insured.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ca038895-5b18-4ec5-bfa2-cea0b6f6abe0\">The previous undisclosed claim in the Jones case had been a substantial claim for jewellery, which went to the heart of the risk of the policy; in the Niramax case the undisclosed facts were irrelevant to the rating of risk.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"aab7a370-cfbd-4b96-81a8-3d16ad5f02e0\">The underwriter in the Jones case had his contemporaneous notes and a transcript of a phone call to support his position; in the Niramax case, there was no contemporaneous evidence and the draft underwriting guidelines for waste risks were only circulated after the loss.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"41eff0c5-4308-4297-afa0-1c2c984a4d59\">Both cases highlight the importance of insurers maintaining up to date underwriting guidelines so as to present credible evidence supported by documents on underwriting decisions, and to support coverage decisions at court before an arbitrator or the Financial Ombudsman Service.

fact that special conditions were imposed by another insurer as part of another insurance contract? Could that amount to an actionable non-disclosure under s. 18 of the Marine Insurance Act (MIA) 1906? This was the main issue in Niramax Group Ltd v. Zurich Insurance plc [2020] EWHC 535 (Comm). The assured, Niramax, is a company carrying out the business of waste collection and waste cycling from various sites in north-east England. Niramax held a suite of insurance policies with the insurer, Zurich, which provided cover for a variety of risks relating to its plant and machinery. One of these policies was a contractor's plant policy which provided all risks cover for a mobile plant owned by the assured (the Policy). Niramax also held buildings cover separately with a variety of other insurers. One of these insurers was Millennium Insurance. In the process of providing insurance cover for a building owned by Niramax in 2014, a risk survey report was prepared by Millennium which laid out seven risk requirements. One of these requirements was the installation of a fire suppression system at the main recycling facility of Niramax located at Hartlepool. Even though the assured was reminded by Millennium of the need to install the fire suppression system on several occasions, the system was never installed and as a result special conditions stipulated by the policy came into force on 22 October 2014 increasing the deductible to £ 250,000 and requiring Niramax to self-insure for thirty five percent of the balance of any loss.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"83adbe3d-56b2-4348-8c4a-1838d3bcccd5\">In December 2014, Niramax renewed its policy with Zurich on the mobile plant. In 2015, Niramax acquired another mobile plant (Eggersmann plant) and in September 2015, Zurich was persuaded to amend the Policy to extend cover to the newly acquired plant until the renewal date of mid-December 2015. On 4 December 2015, a fire broke out at Niramax's premises and the Eggersmann plant along with the other plant was destroyed. Niramax made a claim, which, at trial was valued at around £ 4.5 million, under the Policy. The majority of the claim related to the loss of the Eggersmann plant, which was valued around £ 4.3 million. Zurich refused to pay stating that it was entitled to avoid the Policy for material non-disclosure and/or misrepresentation. Niramax brought the current proceedings against Zurich.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"80aadd7c-a387-4f43-afc5-636370b85951\">It was held that the assured's non-compliance with risk requirements under the buildings policy with Millennium and the imposition of special terms under that policy were materials facts which needed to be disclosed under s. 18(1) of the MIA 1906. However, the insurer (Zurich) failed to demonstrate that, if the facts had been fully disclosed, the Policy for the plant (effected in December 2014) would have been renewed. On the other hand, Zurich was able to demonstrate that, if the facts had been fully disclosed (especially imposition of special circumstances for the assured company (Niramax) by another insurer), the extension of cover for the Eggersmann plant would have been refused. Accordingly, it was held that the insurer, Zurich, was entitled to avoid the cover for the endorsement under the Policy and no indemnity was due for the loss of the Eggermanns plant. The insurer was required to return the premium received for the endorsement. Otherwise, the original Policy stood and the insurer was bound to indemnify Niramax for the items of mobile plant which were covered by the original Policy (as renewed in December 2014) and damaged in the fire.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"45bd1e32-9c60-4dfd-9b7e-5efa84845c36\">Two comments are in order. First, it is interesting to see that the trial judge (Mrs Justice Cockerril) found that the original policy stood (i.e. there was no inducement) even though it would have not been written on the same terms (i.e. with higher premium to reflect the correct multiplier) if full disclosure had been made by the assured. This certainly raises an interesting question going forward on the application of the test of inducement and seems to be at odds with the sentiments expressed by Clarke, LJ, in Assicurazioni Generali SpA v. Arab Insurance Group [2002] EWCA Civ 1642; [2003] Lloyd's Rep IR 131, at [62] (emphasis added): In order to prove inducement the insurer or reinsurer must show that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was an effective cause of his entering into the contract on the terms on which he did. He must therefore show at least that, but for the relevant non-disclosure or misrepresentation, he would not have entered into the contract on those terms. On the other hand, he does not have to show that it was the sole effective cause of his doing so.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"db182725-0c0d-4758-8cd6-a2faff5eaef0\">Second, the contract was obviously concluded before the Insurance Act 2015 (IA) came into force but is highly unlikely that the application of the AA 2015 would have led to a different outcome. The materiality test applicable under the IA 2015 (under s. 7(3) of the IA 2015) is practically the same and there is still a need to prove inducement for actionable non-disclosure under the 2015 Act.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"68b4a7a2-908b-45b8-a50f-71d410781cf7\">on Non-Disclosure, Materiality and Inducement in Commercial Insurance Context (Again)!</p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>","Date":null,"SourceIds":["7d9aeb68-29b0-4108-bcb8-2890ec58f6bf","594986d4-8479-4253-954f-e9cd8ef30032"]},{"FtaDoc":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n<div data-section-id = \"53d5dd5d-b88a-486a-a0f8-8b6e2daad1ee\">\n<h1 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"f38e2040-4717-41f2-a77b-9f87453a6d29\">english law</h1>\n<h2 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"cb9af106-2c7e-441a-ae8e-7e21d7d68c4b\">Posts about english law written by Dr Aygün Mammadzada, IISTL, Professor Barış Soyer, Alicia McKenzie, Professor Richard Williams, Simon Rainey KC, Associate Professor Dr Theodora Nikaki(†), Professor Simon Baughen, and Professor Andrew Tettenborn</h2>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"f84cb590-6a9d-4971-85cf-f198a8e6c89a\">Non-Disclosure, Materiality and Inducement in Commercial Insurance Context (Again)!</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"b2d2fca8-6c0e-41a3-b5d9-9fd8b7800661\">What happens if an assured fails to disclose to the insurer the fact that special conditions were imposed by another insurer as part of another insurance contract?

Zurich also argued that Niramax had failed to disclose certain material factors, notably that it had a \"shadow director\", Shaun Morfitt.

She instructed Zurich to pay back a £32,783 premium, £419,500 for destroyed machines and £82,350 for hired equipment. The amount excluded a new machine supplied by Eggersmann Recycling Technology that had also been lost.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"673e2a23-e469-4180-b18b-b9186d0ce023\">The judgment in Zurich's appeal was handed down on Friday, following a hearing the week before.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2f0f0e39-2195-477e-8a39-d3ee49c92cbc\">Lord Justice Popplewell dismissed an argument that Niramax's actions led to Zurich charging a premium that was unduly low, at £23,714 per year. It was a mistake by one of Zurich's staff, \"not a failure by Niramax to disclose matters relevant to its attitude to risk management, which was the sole cause of the policy being written more cheaply than it would have been,\" he wrote.

All counsel were from 4 New Square. The insured was represented by Ben Elkington QC and Ben Smiley, and insurers were represented by Graham Eklund QC and Carl Troman. The Court's decision is considered by John Williams of 4 New Square.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"dca49d82-3e2f-4813-8f9e-a1271e86d21a\">The facts</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"eacc1c46-5b05-4507-a13a-d1480113df69\">Niramax collected and recycled waste. Its main premises (the recycling facility) were located at Thomlinson Road, Hartlepool. Niramax also processed tyres at sites on Tofts Road, Hartlepool, and ran a waste transfer station in the nearby town of Washington (\" the Washington Site \"). Prior to 2007, part of this waste processing business was run by SWS - a separate subsidiary of Niramax's parent company, \"NHL\". Niramax purchased the business of SWS in 2007, and from then on ran the business across all four sites.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"086eebcf-0f00-4daf-bdca-1d63fd474add\">SWS and Niramax held a suite of insurance policies with Zurich, which covered a variety of risks relating to its plant and machinery. One was a contractor's plant policy (\" the Policy \"), which provided all risks cover for mobile plant. The policy originally incepted in 2006, and was renewed thereafter, up to and including the 2014-15 policy year. Niramax placed buildings cover separately with a variety of underwriters.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"06a5a52d-938d-41e0-9ac0-a50d572237df\">Significantly for the purposes of Niramax's claim, in 2015 it placed an order for the Eggersmann plant; which was due to arrive before the end of the 2015 policy year. Niramax requested that Zurich extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant. Zurich was reluctant (for reasons discussed further below). However, after a lengthy back and forth between Zurich's underwriting team and Niramax's broker, a Mr Sweeney, Zurich agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant from September 2015 until the renewal date of the Policy in mid-December - on the payment of an additional premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"66ac56cc-4242-4497-a382-f42d9f66ba3b\">On 4 December 2015, a fire broke out in the engine compartment of a \"grabber\" at the Thomlinson Road site. This was extinguished promptly - but staff failed to notice that burning embers had spread to a neighbouring building, which housed the Eggersmann plant. It was destroyed, along with other items of machinery.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7508e671-11bd-4c78-9249-f885a36de616\">Niramax made a claim under the Policy which, at trial, was valued at around £4.5 million. The majority of this claim related to the loss of the Eggersmann plant, which it valued at around £4.3 million. Zurich refused to pay, and stated that it was entitled to avoid the Policy for material non-disclosure and misrepresentation. Niramax then brought proceedings in the High Court.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"4144db5c-473b-41cd-ac98-3452e5720872\">Niramax's buildings insurance</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"83d09d79-0aa2-45a0-a2c7-0f705f3aa5f9\">Zurich's primary defence at trial was that there had been material non-disclosure of facts relating to Niramax's buildings cover.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2d44b7d4-bcc5-474b-a142-e7b010f1f194\">For the 2010/11 policy year, Niramax's buildings cover was placed with Paladin, which subsequently withdrew from the market. From 2011 to 2014, cover was placed through a Lloyd's broker (Mr Smith) with a variety of underwriters. For the 2014/15 year, Niramax's underwriters did not offer renewal terms, and Mr Sweeney sought quotes from Mr Smith, and \"Recyclesure\" - a company specialising in recycling industry risks. Recyclesure provided the more competitive quote, for a policy with Millennium Insurance (\" Millennium \"), and this was accepted by Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2d638f1a-41b7-4206-804d-261ae9f3be0a\">Millennium's quote was subject to survey, which took place in February 2014. Mr Sweeney was subsequently sent a report detailing a number of \" risk requirements \". Three risk requirements (an automatic fire detection system, CCTV cameras and hot-spot checking procedures) related to the Washington Road site. Seven risk requirements related to Thomlinson Road - one of which was: \" 3 x fixed Shredders within Black Sand Building: It is necessary to protect shredders by means of an automatic Fire Suppression System. Timescale: within 30 days of survey (by 16 March 14) \".</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c5d38883-e4b6-483b-8a87-0a9bdef081ac\">Throughout 2014 Direct Insurance (on behalf of Millennium) sent chasers to Mr Sweeney asking for updates on the installation of the fire suppression system at Thomlinson Road. This culminated in Millennium imposing special terms on 22 October 2014: the excess under the Millennium Policy was increased to £250,000 per claim, and Niramax was required to self-insure for 35% of the balance of any loss. Notwithstanding this, no fire suppression system was installed before the end of the policy year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9e5a3cc9-e294-418f-b3c4-c5976bf4a7fd\">In December 2014, Niramax sought a renewal quote from Millennium, and a number of other placing brokers, including Mr Smith. Millennium offered renewal terms on the basis of an installation of fire suppression systems at Thomlinson Road, but did not offer cover for Washington Road. A quotation was also provided by Aspen via Mr Smith. Niramax completed proposal forms for Aspen, which included a denial by Niramax that it had ever been subject to special terms imposed by an insurer. This was plainly incorrect, given the history of the Millennium policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"63511612-5adb-4920-b28d-80d328f14a62\">The Aspen quote was accepted, and Aspen were on risk for the 2015/16 policy year.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"5d4fa66d-db4f-4030-ac89-a829c06b42c4\">Niramax's Policy</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"5b234636-7590-4ef6-b7cf-703b7029fef5\">The Policy which formed the basis for Niramax's claim (the contractor's plant policy) originally incepted in 2006, with SWS as the insured. Niramax was added as an insured in 2007/08. The Policy provided all risks cover for loss or damage to owned and hired-in mobile plant. The Policy was renewed with Zurich on broadly similar terms in subsequent years, up to and including the 2014/15 policy year. For 2014/15, the premium was £23,714.40 - an increase of 20% on the previous year. The premium was, despite this increase, below what should have been offered due to the use of an incorrect multiplier.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"db949532-ba0d-48a7-a598-55d3051c3dcf\">In mid-2015, mindful of the arrival of the Eggersmann plant, Niramax (through Mr Sweeney) requested that Zurich add the Eggersmann plant to the Policy. Initially, Zurich refused to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant as it was fixed plant, and the Policy only covered mobile plant. It was suggested that the new machinery should instead be covered under Niramax's property policy. Mr Sweeney persisted, and eventually Zurich agreed to cover the Eggersmann plant until the date of renewal of the Policy in December 2015 - subject to conditions including:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"212aea02-1abc-4599-a0ba-35a398037060\">An increase in the excess under the Policy from £500 to £10,000.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8a0ff2d5-caf4-4144-9cc6-a0a0e54d302f\">A \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d5ce6ec1-ab35-498d-8bd9-9e1d47eba779\">trouble free running in period</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f364be4d-2c26-4434-a824-27a0b03791ca\">\" of 30 days.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e6bb5d5b-70cc-4970-a8d9-9d65ffc6d420\">An increased premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2468b7c2-5492-4454-b5da-2cd4680876f6\">The fire occurred prior to renewal on 4 December 2015, and on renewal, Zurich declined to cover Niramax's fixed plant under the Policy.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"8a9acef5-0c5e-4bff-9e88-7b5926979c8d\">Niramax's Case, and Zurich's Defence</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"b7ac4f34-f336-466f-ba94-a82822b971a9\">Throughout, Niramax argued that it was entitled to an indemnity under the Policy.

At the time of avoidance, Zurich put its case as follows [125]-[130]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"999236f9-b687-4b25-ad7f-63eb891e2b00\">It contended that Niramax had failed to disclose five material circumstances.

On this basis, Zurich sought to avoid its obligations to indemnify Niramax, in whole or in part.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"43c7b244-7be6-41b1-9b03-f28a7c36b258\">Applicable legal principles</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"4b650c62-ade3-494d-b345-78dcd3b72901\">It is for the party pleading non-disclosure (here, Zurich) to show that the relevant matter was \"material\" to the decision to write the risk. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 (\" the 1906 Act \") states that an insured must \" disclose to the insurer, before the contract is concluded, every material circumstance which is known to the assured, and the assured is deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known to him \" (s 18). A fact is material if it would \" influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the premium, or determining whether he will take the risk \" (s 18(2)).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"49b9a740-4f4e-495a-a8c1-8ead71ea0e1b\">The judgment cited a number of further principles relevant to materiality, relying on the decisions of Carr J in Brit UW Ltd v F & B Trenchless Solutions Ltd [2016] Lloyd's Rep IR 69, and Leggatt J in Involnert Management v Aprilgrange Ltd [2015] 2 Lloyd's Rep 289 [133.iii]. These include the need for courts to take an objective approach to assessing materiality, based on the judge's independent appraisal of the alleged material circumstance in light of the facts at hand. Expert evidence is \" helpful and important to ensure that the court's findings are grounded in commercial reality \", but it is ultimately for the court to decide whether it is rational to take any particular matter into account.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"01a7dd91-e12e-4f91-8551-57f2b99823de\">Second to materiality, Zurich had to show that any non-disclosure or misrepresentation relied on induced it to write the contract which was in fact written, on a \"but for\" basis [133.iv]. In the words of Clarke LJ in Assicurazioni Generali SpA v Arab Insurance Group [2003] 2 CLC 242 at [62]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"01e9f57b-3396-42fb-9d48-82304252f8b8\">In order to prove inducement the insurer or reinsurer must show that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was an effective cause of his entering into the contract on the terms on which he did. He must therefore show at least that, but for the relevant non-disclosure or misrepresentation, he would not have entered into the contract on those terms. On the other hand, he does not have to show that it was the sole effective cause of his doing so.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e62073b1-07da-484b-831b-056ae9ae9260\">The burden for proving inducement is \" not a heavy one \" [134]. But the judge acknowledged that caution had to be exercised given that (1) avoidance is a draconian remedy which should not be lightly granted and (2) genuine evidence on inducement could nevertheless be inaccurate due to the effects of hindsight and party interest, and the difficulty of examining hypotheticals. The latter proved especially relevant given the shift in Zurich's case prior to trial.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"7e1a673a-98e7-4078-94d3-c571cfe443b8\">Zurich's Primary Defence: Risk Requirements and Special Terms</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"ad95f534-856c-48d7-a00d-c4e35cc04ba7\">Materiality</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ffa81f06-a267-41cb-b33d-c9b4d2dfdb9e\">In relation to the risk requirements/special terms defence, both parties advanced expert evidence on the issue of materiality. The experts (broadly speaking) agreed that Niramax's non-compliance with risk requirements under the buildings policy, and the imposition of special terms by Millennium, were material. Those facts shone a light on Niramax's attitude to risk management, and demonstrated \" poor housekeeping \" [158]. The judge rejected an argument by Niramax that it was \" actively engaged in compliance \" during the course of 2014 - noting its \" lackadaisical \" approach to sourcing a suitable fire suppression system [141].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2b3e50a7-2d70-4375-b72b-2d4f68b9e73b\">Inducement</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"89d38505-fc82-4909-97d2-7f8a4710de18\">The question of inducement was more complex. It raised three key preliminary issues: (1) the identity of the underwriter (2) the effect of any extra information provided if fuller disclosure had been made, and (3) the nature of the underwriting process.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d221d9f2-ecbd-4395-80b7-ba7ebfa8dc57\">First, the court had to identify which member of Zurich's underwriting team would have made the final decision on whether to offer cover (in December 2014, and September 2015), had proper disclosure been made. The judge found - in accordance with the case advanced by Zurich - that the decision would have been referred up the chain to Mr Penny, the head of its engineering risks department. It followed that \" what Mr Penny would have done \" became the crucial question when considering inducement [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"98482761-5e63-4f53-872c-193598b6fd82\">On the second issue, the judge accepted an argument advanced by Niramax that any findings on inducement should also account for the effect on underwriters of positive information about Niramax's business practices, which would have come out if fuller disclosure had been made. However, this argument cut both ways. If a full underwriting assessment had been given, it may also have brought into play \" some less attractive features \" [192]. In the round, the judge found that a fuller presentation would not have had much effect on the overall balance of the underwriting decision.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5eb0abcf-4f9b-4f72-82cb-4d41ccea83ee\">On the third issue, the judge rejected Niramax's case that even if proper disclosure had been made, it would not have had any impact on the underwriting process [195]. Niramax based its submission on the fact that Zurich had treated the mobile plant policy in a \" commoditised and streamlined \" way [25]. There was no proposal form, and Zurich calculated premiums based only on sums insured, trade and claims experience. Niramax argued that Zurich would have done the same at the time of the 2014 renewal, even if proper disclosure had been made; but the judge found this position unpersuasive. Had proper disclosure been made, the usual process for \" vanilla \" risks would not have been followed, and underwriters would have undertaken a more detailed analysis [200].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"be23691c-346c-43c0-8fd0-942d6e845b18\">Findings</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b500546e-5856-4e5b-9b69-a738868defbc\">That left the ultimate question - what would Mr Penny have done, if presented with the new information? The conclusion: \" it is more likely than not that if he had been aware of the facts in question Mr Penny would have reluctantly offered renewal terms in December 2014 but would have refused the extension to cover the Eggersmann plant in September 2015 \" [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e3a65a3d-9378-45c0-87e2-715636a01ca0\">A critical factor in Mr Penny's deliberations both in 2014 and in 2015 was the undesirability of recycling risks. In the years prior to 2013, the waste and recycling industry had come to be seen as a hazard for insurers, particularly due to fire losses [202]. In mid-2013, Mr Penny had instructed his underwriting team to stop covering fixed plant waste risks on engineering contractor's plant policies, and a 10% rate increase was subsequently levied on such risks [204]. By late 2014, the judge found that Zurich had effectively stopped writing new policies for waste risks, and was \" kicking…out \" much of its existing waste business [205]. This hostility to waste risks continued as time went on, and by the time the Eggersmann plant was added in late 2015, Mr Penny's attitude would have been even more adverse than it was at the time of renewal in December 2014 [217].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a63e225e-2da7-4e7f-a2cf-91284d91a46d\">In December 2014, Mr Penny would still have written the Policy - though with a higher premium to reflect the correct multiplier. This would have been done out of a sense of \" fair play \", and given the \" less than striking \" nature of the extra information which should have been disclosed [212]. On this basis, the judge found that the test for inducement was not satisfied. This was despite the factual finding that if proper disclosure had been made, the Policy would only have been written on different terms (applying the correct multiplier).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a547a784-8b05-4422-acb8-dbd9d244d3e0\">However, Mr Penny would not have agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann risk in 2015. As the judge found: \" By September 2015 the thinking in Zurich had moved further along the timeline of hostility to waste risks. So, the backdrop on this aspect would be no better for Niramax than it was as at December 2014, but rather worse. And at this stage we hypothesise that Mr Penny is presented with a fixed plant risk of considerable size which has no place in the mobile plant policy - as Mr Penny himself had made clear to his team in July 2013 - together with these facts relating to the risk requirements and special terms.\" [217]</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ba6bd57d-b10e-4d01-b37c-f242f7af7025\">When the Eggersmann plant extension was written in, after coaxing by Mr Sweeney, it was a marginal decision even without further disclosure. Had proper disclosure been given, three factors would have carried the decision \" from a very reluctant write to a polite but firm refusal \" [220]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"1adc229a-61a1-4f65-b28c-3bb76b6b9bc8\">The impact of the information disclosed. The Eggersmann machine was a substantial item of fixed plant, which was to be underwritten without a survey. Fixed plant was inherently at greater risk than mobile plant due to its lack of mobility. Questions over Niramax's risk management in the recent past would have been enough to tip the decision into a refusal for any of Zurich's underwriters [220].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"584745ad-8c2d-4c73-80d1-e0c473cfdeab\">Mr Penny personally was highly sensitive to the \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b96abc3a-2169-4618-aaec-a6a2f00d42bd\">direction of travel</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ddd4c61f-c722-4675-8cbd-82b4182ba4c0\">\" in relation to waste risks [221]. He had himself set a rule that there was to be no fixed plant on waste risks, and there was no reason to think that Mr Penny would have broken his own rule in the case of Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9073cd20-3821-41ea-9c76-33b3f236af89\">Mr Penny came across as a \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e322338a-3fa5-4d13-967f-9bd12d0d84f3\">\" when giving evidence, who would have been even less willing to accommodate the client than other underwriters in Zurich's team [223]. That included Mr Hutchinson, a senior underwriter in the engineering team, who took the decision in September 2015 to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"0ba46f17-635b-403b-b535-56f0cae22d31\">Zurich's other defences</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"d634a9a2-c8db-40f0-9433-af445fcaf35d\">Given those findings, the Millennium Renewal Terms and the Aspen Defence fell away, as they only related to the 2015 extension. In any event, they would have had little or no effect on inducing Mr Penny in the circumstances of the case [228]-[230].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"110b0d45-3215-486c-b952-8a12a1c45352\">On the remaining defences advanced:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"277a7c02-29c3-40ee-869c-0f569defebd5\">The Sweeney Representation Defence was unpersuasive. There was no evidence that Niramax was aware of the representations being made by Mr Sweeney, and those representations were pieces of \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"850879bf-2386-4417-a9dd-503eed913a71\">The 2012 Fire Defence did not succeed. Its materiality was doubtful: the fire was small and at a site which was not owned, operated or insured by Niramax. In any event, Mr Penny's evidence did not suggest that it would have met the inducement hurdle [235]-[236].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"4986f269-4854-4fa7-af77-30d544a9ceea\">The 2006 Fine Defence was also unlikely to be material, due to the lapse of time, and the fact that it related to a different company and location - as well as given subsequent changes in management. Even if material, it would not (together or in combination with the other defences) have induced Mr Penny to refuse to write the risk or to write it on different terms [237]-[238].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"77e9e4e9-b508-47c7-95e2-af93ca77cc0f\">The Dean Fine Defence also did not meet the threshold of inducement. The conviction had been spent for over 6 months at the time of renewal, and Mr Dean was not a director of Niramax at the time of the fine or of renewal [239].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e288d264-92c1-47a8-8941-b3d3bbf4fea9\">The final point as to non-disclosure of Niramax's breach of duty for failing to disclose material facts on earlier renewals also failed. There was no evidence to show that Niramax knew that it had previously failed to disclose material circumstances - and given the above, it would also have failed on the facts [240].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"d5677a35-7e44-4982-a2f3-39d5396bfd9e\">Quantum</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"10ec8c5b-390f-4e19-b393-589150ad3e15\">Zurich was ordered to return the premium received for the September extension (£32,782.62), and no indemnity was due for the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ccda55c5-ef87-4f02-b250-20ae4770573d\">Otherwise, the Policy stood, and Zurich was bound to indemnify Niramax for the items of mobile plant which were covered by the original Policy (as renewed in 2014) and damaged in the fire: two Liebherr excavators, and a Liebherr material handler. According to the Policy wording, Zurich was to pay \" the market value of the item at the time of the loss or damage \", and Zurich's internal guidance was that this meant \" the cost of a replacement item of similar age and condition \" [246].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"544a2d48-dbf1-41b2-9726-41670d50bb80\">The judge preferred the (higher) valuations of Niramax's expert (Mr Correa) of £126,000 and £127,500 for the two excavators, and £167,750 for the material handler. In part, this was due to Mr Correa's greater relevant expertise in loss adjusting, by comparison with the expert instructed by Zurich, Professor Sheldon. The judge also preferred Mr Correa's methodology [255]-[263]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"aac89285-8f33-44ef-aee9-b0e8e18c3356\">The Sheldon valuations extrapolated from a single quoted price for each of the machines in 2019. These quotes were selected from a broader range of quoted prices, some of which were higher than those given in evidence.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f3699e67-8012-4205-8e7d-bcc6180320b2\">The Sheldon valuations took into account only foreign sales (there was no UK market for the plant), but failed to account for the cost of purchasing replacement plant in England - including transport costs, insurance and permits.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"bbda1b36-d63b-40a6-832e-21f7c1d8bc50\">The Sheldon calculations depreciated the items of plant (including the essentially identical excavators) at different rates for no discernible reason. The Correa valuation used the same 2.5% annual rate across each item, and this approach was deemed more credible in light of Mr Correa's expertise.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"530fa63b-88de-4483-8c30-ef85c019cf89\">The Correa figures cross-checked well against other reference figures - including those given by Zurich's loss adjusters Crawfords, and figures based on a 2019 valuation from Liebherr, discounted back to 2015.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3b8deb12-774e-4e2a-a097-4a2ee5de3643\">Although it was not necessary given her findings on liability, the judge also preferred Niramax's valuation of the Eggersmann plant (£4,308,582) to Zurich's (£3,765,828) [249]-[254]. The machine was effectively brand new, and it was therefore appropriate to take the indemnity value as being the cost of a new replacement machine (in accordance with a subsequent quotation provided by Eggersmann).</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"f11482e5-160c-4e8f-a2ce-4a8dc6ec3168\">Comment</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"de265230-f5c5-467f-90f8-4c3c7c150e55\">Non-disclosure cases turn, to a large extent, on their particular facts. But the decision in Niramax is a helpful illustration of how courts approach and apply the rules on material non-disclosure under the 1906 Act - in particular, in relation to the vexed issue of hypotheticals. Similar considerations are likely to apply to cases falling under the new provisions in Part 2 of the Insurance Act 2015.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a622204a-8610-4852-8309-19e74724659c\">One contentious element of the judge's reasoning relates to her finding that the \"original\" Policy stood - even though it would not have been written on the same terms if proper disclosure had been made (because Mr Penny would have accounted for the correct multiplier as part of the premium). The judge refused permission to appeal on this ground, but her findings on inducement raise interesting questions about how the test should be applied in circumstances where the policy would in fact have only been written on different terms.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"0bc3aaf1-2b87-424f-85a5-5b5868ea41de\">Keywords: Inducement, Materiality, Measure of indemnity, Misrepresentation, Non-disclosure, Property Insurance, Reinstatement</p>\n<figure class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"344fcafa-a6f9-4e4d-91af-43f645c3cd7d\">\n\t<img src=https://www.4newsquare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/4ns-q-banner-1.jpg/>\n\t<figcaption>Avoidance for Material Non-Diclosure: Niramax Group Limited v Zurich Insurance Plc [2020] EWHC 535 (Comm)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>","Date":{"Year":2020,"Month":5,"MonthShort":"May","Day":18},"SourceIds":["93fa0ad7-cc2c-4783-af31-f23808401fe4","bd903244-1e1a-4ba9-acb2-06f164c22265"]},{"FtaDoc":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n<div data-section-id = \"90fb0b1a-2d1a-42b7-a805-45c04cef700d\">\n<h1 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"7cc8f72d-4b43-4455-87d0-31ece263d8f4\">Avoidance for Material Non-Diclosure: Niramax Group Limited v Zurich Insurance Plc [2020] EWHC 535 (Comm)</h1>\n<h2 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"21fdcb27-e98a-441d-9583-43b2e4787113\">In Niramax Group Limited v Zurich Insurance Plc [2020] EWHC 535 (Comm) the High Court considered the principles applicable to cases of avoidance for material non-disclosure, in a claim by a policyholder against its insurers.

All counsel were from 4 New Square. The insured was represented by Ben Elkington QC and Ben Smiley, and insurers were represented by Graham Eklund QC and Carl Troman. The Court's decision is considered by John Williams of 4 New Square.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"dca49d82-3e2f-4813-8f9e-a1271e86d21a\">The facts</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"eacc1c46-5b05-4507-a13a-d1480113df69\">Niramax collected and recycled waste. Its main premises (the recycling facility) were located at Thomlinson Road, Hartlepool. Niramax also processed tyres at sites on Tofts Road, Hartlepool, and ran a waste transfer station in the nearby town of Washington (\" the Washington Site \"). Prior to 2007, part of this waste processing business was run by SWS - a separate subsidiary of Niramax's parent company, \"NHL\". Niramax purchased the business of SWS in 2007, and from then on ran the business across all four sites.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"086eebcf-0f00-4daf-bdca-1d63fd474add\">SWS and Niramax held a suite of insurance policies with Zurich, which covered a variety of risks relating to its plant and machinery. One was a contractor's plant policy (\" the Policy \"), which provided all risks cover for mobile plant. The policy originally incepted in 2006, and was renewed thereafter, up to and including the 2014-15 policy year. Niramax placed buildings cover separately with a variety of underwriters.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"06a5a52d-938d-41e0-9ac0-a50d572237df\">Significantly for the purposes of Niramax's claim, in 2015 it placed an order for the Eggersmann plant; which was due to arrive before the end of the 2015 policy year. Niramax requested that Zurich extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant. Zurich was reluctant (for reasons discussed further below). However, after a lengthy back and forth between Zurich's underwriting team and Niramax's broker, a Mr Sweeney, Zurich agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant from September 2015 until the renewal date of the Policy in mid-December - on the payment of an additional premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"66ac56cc-4242-4497-a382-f42d9f66ba3b\">On 4 December 2015, a fire broke out in the engine compartment of a \"grabber\" at the Thomlinson Road site. This was extinguished promptly - but staff failed to notice that burning embers had spread to a neighbouring building, which housed the Eggersmann plant. It was destroyed, along with other items of machinery.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7508e671-11bd-4c78-9249-f885a36de616\">Niramax made a claim under the Policy which, at trial, was valued at around £4.5 million. The majority of this claim related to the loss of the Eggersmann plant, which it valued at around £4.3 million. Zurich refused to pay, and stated that it was entitled to avoid the Policy for material non-disclosure and misrepresentation. Niramax then brought proceedings in the High Court.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"4144db5c-473b-41cd-ac98-3452e5720872\">Niramax's buildings insurance</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"83d09d79-0aa2-45a0-a2c7-0f705f3aa5f9\">Zurich's primary defence at trial was that there had been material non-disclosure of facts relating to Niramax's buildings cover.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2d44b7d4-bcc5-474b-a142-e7b010f1f194\">For the 2010/11 policy year, Niramax's buildings cover was placed with Paladin, which subsequently withdrew from the market. From 2011 to 2014, cover was placed through a Lloyd's broker (Mr Smith) with a variety of underwriters. For the 2014/15 year, Niramax's underwriters did not offer renewal terms, and Mr Sweeney sought quotes from Mr Smith, and \"Recyclesure\" - a company specialising in recycling industry risks. Recyclesure provided the more competitive quote, for a policy with Millennium Insurance (\" Millennium \"), and this was accepted by Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2d638f1a-41b7-4206-804d-261ae9f3be0a\">Millennium's quote was subject to survey, which took place in February 2014. Mr Sweeney was subsequently sent a report detailing a number of \" risk requirements \". Three risk requirements (an automatic fire detection system, CCTV cameras and hot-spot checking procedures) related to the Washington Road site. Seven risk requirements related to Thomlinson Road - one of which was: \" 3 x fixed Shredders within Black Sand Building: It is necessary to protect shredders by means of an automatic Fire Suppression System. Timescale: within 30 days of survey (by 16 March 14) \".</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c5d38883-e4b6-483b-8a87-0a9bdef081ac\">Throughout 2014 Direct Insurance (on behalf of Millennium) sent chasers to Mr Sweeney asking for updates on the installation of the fire suppression system at Thomlinson Road. This culminated in Millennium imposing special terms on 22 October 2014: the excess under the Millennium Policy was increased to £250,000 per claim, and Niramax was required to self-insure for 35% of the balance of any loss. Notwithstanding this, no fire suppression system was installed before the end of the policy year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9e5a3cc9-e294-418f-b3c4-c5976bf4a7fd\">In December 2014, Niramax sought a renewal quote from Millennium, and a number of other placing brokers, including Mr Smith. Millennium offered renewal terms on the basis of an installation of fire suppression systems at Thomlinson Road, but did not offer cover for Washington Road. A quotation was also provided by Aspen via Mr Smith. Niramax completed proposal forms for Aspen, which included a denial by Niramax that it had ever been subject to special terms imposed by an insurer. This was plainly incorrect, given the history of the Millennium policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"63511612-5adb-4920-b28d-80d328f14a62\">The Aspen quote was accepted, and Aspen were on risk for the 2015/16 policy year.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"5d4fa66d-db4f-4030-ac89-a829c06b42c4\">Niramax's Policy</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"5b234636-7590-4ef6-b7cf-703b7029fef5\">The Policy which formed the basis for Niramax's claim (the contractor's plant policy) originally incepted in 2006, with SWS as the insured. Niramax was added as an insured in 2007/08. The Policy provided all risks cover for loss or damage to owned and hired-in mobile plant. The Policy was renewed with Zurich on broadly similar terms in subsequent years, up to and including the 2014/15 policy year. For 2014/15, the premium was £23,714.40 - an increase of 20% on the previous year. The premium was, despite this increase, below what should have been offered due to the use of an incorrect multiplier.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"db949532-ba0d-48a7-a598-55d3051c3dcf\">In mid-2015, mindful of the arrival of the Eggersmann plant, Niramax (through Mr Sweeney) requested that Zurich add the Eggersmann plant to the Policy. Initially, Zurich refused to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant as it was fixed plant, and the Policy only covered mobile plant. It was suggested that the new machinery should instead be covered under Niramax's property policy. Mr Sweeney persisted, and eventually Zurich agreed to cover the Eggersmann plant until the date of renewal of the Policy in December 2015 - subject to conditions including:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"212aea02-1abc-4599-a0ba-35a398037060\">An increase in the excess under the Policy from £500 to £10,000.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8a0ff2d5-caf4-4144-9cc6-a0a0e54d302f\">A \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d5ce6ec1-ab35-498d-8bd9-9e1d47eba779\">trouble free running in period</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f364be4d-2c26-4434-a824-27a0b03791ca\">\" of 30 days.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e6bb5d5b-70cc-4970-a8d9-9d65ffc6d420\">An increased premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2468b7c2-5492-4454-b5da-2cd4680876f6\">The fire occurred prior to renewal on 4 December 2015, and on renewal, Zurich declined to cover Niramax's fixed plant under the Policy.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"8a9acef5-0c5e-4bff-9e88-7b5926979c8d\">Niramax's Case, and Zurich's Defence</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"b7ac4f34-f336-466f-ba94-a82822b971a9\">Throughout, Niramax argued that it was entitled to an indemnity under the Policy.

At the time of avoidance, Zurich put its case as follows [125]-[130]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"999236f9-b687-4b25-ad7f-63eb891e2b00\">It contended that Niramax had failed to disclose five material circumstances. In particular, Zurich advanced the \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7e08e3b3-88ff-4c44-96f7-b57b77b0d1f8\">\": an allegation that Mr Shaun Morfitt, who had been imprisoned for a serious criminal offence in 2010, was a shadow director of Niramax; and that his conviction should therefore have been disclosed to Zurich.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"67a22522-e8da-421a-b396-0d5121d5f470\">Zurich asserted that Niramax was in breach of conditions precedent under the Policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e0791d65-4110-43a9-a023-ce2b3bcd70fa\">Zurich later dropped the Morfitt Defence, and the breach of conditions defence.

On this basis, Zurich sought to avoid its obligations to indemnify Niramax, in whole or in part.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"43c7b244-7be6-41b1-9b03-f28a7c36b258\">Applicable legal principles</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"4b650c62-ade3-494d-b345-78dcd3b72901\">It is for the party pleading non-disclosure (here, Zurich) to show that the relevant matter was \"material\" to the decision to write the risk. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 (\" the 1906 Act \") states that an insured must \" disclose to the insurer, before the contract is concluded, every material circumstance which is known to the assured, and the assured is deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known to him \" (s 18). A fact is material if it would \" influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the premium, or determining whether he will take the risk \" (s 18(2)).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"49b9a740-4f4e-495a-a8c1-8ead71ea0e1b\">The judgment cited a number of further principles relevant to materiality, relying on the decisions of Carr J in Brit UW Ltd v F & B Trenchless Solutions Ltd [2016] Lloyd's Rep IR 69, and Leggatt J in Involnert Management v Aprilgrange Ltd [2015] 2 Lloyd's Rep 289 [133.iii]. These include the need for courts to take an objective approach to assessing materiality, based on the judge's independent appraisal of the alleged material circumstance in light of the facts at hand. Expert evidence is \" helpful and important to ensure that the court's findings are grounded in commercial reality \", but it is ultimately for the court to decide whether it is rational to take any particular matter into account.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"01a7dd91-e12e-4f91-8551-57f2b99823de\">Second to materiality, Zurich had to show that any non-disclosure or misrepresentation relied on induced it to write the contract which was in fact written, on a \"but for\" basis [133.iv]. In the words of Clarke LJ in Assicurazioni Generali SpA v Arab Insurance Group [2003] 2 CLC 242 at [62]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"01e9f57b-3396-42fb-9d48-82304252f8b8\">In order to prove inducement the insurer or reinsurer must show that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was an effective cause of his entering into the contract on the terms on which he did. He must therefore show at least that, but for the relevant non-disclosure or misrepresentation, he would not have entered into the contract on those terms. On the other hand, he does not have to show that it was the sole effective cause of his doing so.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e62073b1-07da-484b-831b-056ae9ae9260\">The burden for proving inducement is \" not a heavy one \" [134]. But the judge acknowledged that caution had to be exercised given that (1) avoidance is a draconian remedy which should not be lightly granted and (2) genuine evidence on inducement could nevertheless be inaccurate due to the effects of hindsight and party interest, and the difficulty of examining hypotheticals. The latter proved especially relevant given the shift in Zurich's case prior to trial.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"7e1a673a-98e7-4078-94d3-c571cfe443b8\">Zurich's Primary Defence: Risk Requirements and Special Terms</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"ad95f534-856c-48d7-a00d-c4e35cc04ba7\">Materiality</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ffa81f06-a267-41cb-b33d-c9b4d2dfdb9e\">In relation to the risk requirements/special terms defence, both parties advanced expert evidence on the issue of materiality. The experts (broadly speaking) agreed that Niramax's non-compliance with risk requirements under the buildings policy, and the imposition of special terms by Millennium, were material. Those facts shone a light on Niramax's attitude to risk management, and demonstrated \" poor housekeeping \" [158]. The judge rejected an argument by Niramax that it was \" actively engaged in compliance \" during the course of 2014 - noting its \" lackadaisical \" approach to sourcing a suitable fire suppression system [141].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2b3e50a7-2d70-4375-b72b-2d4f68b9e73b\">Inducement</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"89d38505-fc82-4909-97d2-7f8a4710de18\">The question of inducement was more complex. It raised three key preliminary issues: (1) the identity of the underwriter (2) the effect of any extra information provided if fuller disclosure had been made, and (3) the nature of the underwriting process.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d221d9f2-ecbd-4395-80b7-ba7ebfa8dc57\">First, the court had to identify which member of Zurich's underwriting team would have made the final decision on whether to offer cover (in December 2014, and September 2015), had proper disclosure been made. The judge found - in accordance with the case advanced by Zurich - that the decision would have been referred up the chain to Mr Penny, the head of its engineering risks department. It followed that \" what Mr Penny would have done \" became the crucial question when considering inducement [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"98482761-5e63-4f53-872c-193598b6fd82\">On the second issue, the judge accepted an argument advanced by Niramax that any findings on inducement should also account for the effect on underwriters of positive information about Niramax's business practices, which would have come out if fuller disclosure had been made. However, this argument cut both ways. If a full underwriting assessment had been given, it may also have brought into play \" some less attractive features \" [192]. In the round, the judge found that a fuller presentation would not have had much effect on the overall balance of the underwriting decision.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5eb0abcf-4f9b-4f72-82cb-4d41ccea83ee\">On the third issue, the judge rejected Niramax's case that even if proper disclosure had been made, it would not have had any impact on the underwriting process [195]. Niramax based its submission on the fact that Zurich had treated the mobile plant policy in a \" commoditised and streamlined \" way [25]. There was no proposal form, and Zurich calculated premiums based only on sums insured, trade and claims experience. Niramax argued that Zurich would have done the same at the time of the 2014 renewal, even if proper disclosure had been made; but the judge found this position unpersuasive. Had proper disclosure been made, the usual process for \" vanilla \" risks would not have been followed, and underwriters would have undertaken a more detailed analysis [200].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"be23691c-346c-43c0-8fd0-942d6e845b18\">Findings</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b500546e-5856-4e5b-9b69-a738868defbc\">That left the ultimate question - what would Mr Penny have done, if presented with the new information? The conclusion: \" it is more likely than not that if he had been aware of the facts in question Mr Penny would have reluctantly offered renewal terms in December 2014 but would have refused the extension to cover the Eggersmann plant in September 2015 \" [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e3a65a3d-9378-45c0-87e2-715636a01ca0\">A critical factor in Mr Penny's deliberations both in 2014 and in 2015 was the undesirability of recycling risks. In the years prior to 2013, the waste and recycling industry had come to be seen as a hazard for insurers, particularly due to fire losses [202]. In mid-2013, Mr Penny had instructed his underwriting team to stop covering fixed plant waste risks on engineering contractor's plant policies, and a 10% rate increase was subsequently levied on such risks [204]. By late 2014, the judge found that Zurich had effectively stopped writing new policies for waste risks, and was \" kicking…out \" much of its existing waste business [205]. This hostility to waste risks continued as time went on, and by the time the Eggersmann plant was added in late 2015, Mr Penny's attitude would have been even more adverse than it was at the time of renewal in December 2014 [217].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a63e225e-2da7-4e7f-a2cf-91284d91a46d\">In December 2014, Mr Penny would still have written the Policy - though with a higher premium to reflect the correct multiplier. This would have been done out of a sense of \" fair play \", and given the \" less than striking \" nature of the extra information which should have been disclosed [212]. On this basis, the judge found that the test for inducement was not satisfied. This was despite the factual finding that if proper disclosure had been made, the Policy would only have been written on different terms (applying the correct multiplier).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a547a784-8b05-4422-acb8-dbd9d244d3e0\">However, Mr Penny would not have agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann risk in 2015. As the judge found: \" By September 2015 the thinking in Zurich had moved further along the timeline of hostility to waste risks. So, the backdrop on this aspect would be no better for Niramax than it was as at December 2014, but rather worse. And at this stage we hypothesise that Mr Penny is presented with a fixed plant risk of considerable size which has no place in the mobile plant policy - as Mr Penny himself had made clear to his team in July 2013 - together with these facts relating to the risk requirements and special terms.\" [217]</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ba6bd57d-b10e-4d01-b37c-f242f7af7025\">When the Eggersmann plant extension was written in, after coaxing by Mr Sweeney, it was a marginal decision even without further disclosure. Had proper disclosure been given, three factors would have carried the decision \" from a very reluctant write to a polite but firm refusal \" [220]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"1adc229a-61a1-4f65-b28c-3bb76b6b9bc8\">The impact of the information disclosed. The Eggersmann machine was a substantial item of fixed plant, which was to be underwritten without a survey. Fixed plant was inherently at greater risk than mobile plant due to its lack of mobility. Questions over Niramax's risk management in the recent past would have been enough to tip the decision into a refusal for any of Zurich's underwriters [220].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"584745ad-8c2d-4c73-80d1-e0c473cfdeab\">Mr Penny personally was highly sensitive to the \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b96abc3a-2169-4618-aaec-a6a2f00d42bd\">direction of travel</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ddd4c61f-c722-4675-8cbd-82b4182ba4c0\">\" in relation to waste risks [221]. He had himself set a rule that there was to be no fixed plant on waste risks, and there was no reason to think that Mr Penny would have broken his own rule in the case of Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9073cd20-3821-41ea-9c76-33b3f236af89\">Mr Penny came across as a \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e322338a-3fa5-4d13-967f-9bd12d0d84f3\">\" when giving evidence, who would have been even less willing to accommodate the client than other underwriters in Zurich's team [223]. That included Mr Hutchinson, a senior underwriter in the engineering team, who took the decision in September 2015 to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"0ba46f17-635b-403b-b535-56f0cae22d31\">Zurich's other defences</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"d634a9a2-c8db-40f0-9433-af445fcaf35d\">Given those findings, the Millennium Renewal Terms and the Aspen Defence fell away, as they only related to the 2015 extension. In any event, they would have had little or no effect on inducing Mr Penny in the circumstances of the case [228]-[230].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"110b0d45-3215-486c-b952-8a12a1c45352\">On the remaining defences advanced:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"277a7c02-29c3-40ee-869c-0f569defebd5\">The Sweeney Representation Defence was unpersuasive. There was no evidence that Niramax was aware of the representations being made by Mr Sweeney, and those representations were pieces of \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"850879bf-2386-4417-a9dd-503eed913a71\">The 2012 Fire Defence did not succeed. Its materiality was doubtful: the fire was small and at a site which was not owned, operated or insured by Niramax. In any event, Mr Penny's evidence did not suggest that it would have met the inducement hurdle [235]-[236].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"4986f269-4854-4fa7-af77-30d544a9ceea\">The 2006 Fine Defence was also unlikely to be material, due to the lapse of time, and the fact that it related to a different company and location - as well as given subsequent changes in management. Even if material, it would not (together or in combination with the other defences) have induced Mr Penny to refuse to write the risk or to write it on different terms [237]-[238].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"77e9e4e9-b508-47c7-95e2-af93ca77cc0f\">The Dean Fine Defence also did not meet the threshold of inducement. The conviction had been spent for over 6 months at the time of renewal, and Mr Dean was not a director of Niramax at the time of the fine or of renewal [239].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e288d264-92c1-47a8-8941-b3d3bbf4fea9\">The final point as to non-disclosure of Niramax's breach of duty for failing to disclose material facts on earlier renewals also failed. There was no evidence to show that Niramax knew that it had previously failed to disclose material circumstances - and given the above, it would also have failed on the facts [240].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"d5677a35-7e44-4982-a2f3-39d5396bfd9e\">Quantum</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"10ec8c5b-390f-4e19-b393-589150ad3e15\">Zurich was ordered to return the premium received for the September extension (£32,782.62), and no indemnity was due for the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ccda55c5-ef87-4f02-b250-20ae4770573d\">Otherwise, the Policy stood, and Zurich was bound to indemnify Niramax for the items of mobile plant which were covered by the original Policy (as renewed in 2014) and damaged in the fire: two Liebherr excavators, and a Liebherr material handler. According to the Policy wording, Zurich was to pay \" the market value of the item at the time of the loss or damage \", and Zurich's internal guidance was that this meant \" the cost of a replacement item of similar age and condition \" [246].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"544a2d48-dbf1-41b2-9726-41670d50bb80\">The judge preferred the (higher) valuations of Niramax's expert (Mr Correa) of £126,000 and £127,500 for the two excavators, and £167,750 for the material handler. In part, this was due to Mr Correa's greater relevant expertise in loss adjusting, by comparison with the expert instructed by Zurich, Professor Sheldon. The judge also preferred Mr Correa's methodology [255]-[263]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"aac89285-8f33-44ef-aee9-b0e8e18c3356\">The Sheldon valuations extrapolated from a single quoted price for each of the machines in 2019. These quotes were selected from a broader range of quoted prices, some of which were higher than those given in evidence.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f3699e67-8012-4205-8e7d-bcc6180320b2\">The Sheldon valuations took into account only foreign sales (there was no UK market for the plant), but failed to account for the cost of purchasing replacement plant in England - including transport costs, insurance and permits.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"bbda1b36-d63b-40a6-832e-21f7c1d8bc50\">The Sheldon calculations depreciated the items of plant (including the essentially identical excavators) at different rates for no discernible reason. The Correa valuation used the same 2.5% annual rate across each item, and this approach was deemed more credible in light of Mr Correa's expertise.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"530fa63b-88de-4483-8c30-ef85c019cf89\">The Correa figures cross-checked well against other reference figures - including those given by Zurich's loss adjusters Crawfords, and figures based on a 2019 valuation from Liebherr, discounted back to 2015.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3b8deb12-774e-4e2a-a097-4a2ee5de3643\">Although it was not necessary given her findings on liability, the judge also preferred Niramax's valuation of the Eggersmann plant (£4,308,582) to Zurich's (£3,765,828) [249]-[254]. The machine was effectively brand new, and it was therefore appropriate to take the indemnity value as being the cost of a new replacement machine (in accordance with a subsequent quotation provided by Eggersmann).</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"f11482e5-160c-4e8f-a2ce-4a8dc6ec3168\">Comment</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"de265230-f5c5-467f-90f8-4c3c7c150e55\">Non-disclosure cases turn, to a large extent, on their particular facts. But the decision in Niramax is a helpful illustration of how courts approach and apply the rules on material non-disclosure under the 1906 Act - in particular, in relation to the vexed issue of hypotheticals.

I have been told by individuals in the north-east about this company and what it did. It was set up, bought into the waste management business, had various sites around the north-east and other parts of the country, and I think it was running both scams: not only was it running the inert and active waste scam, but there is a question as to how much landfill tax was actually being paid on stuff it was dumping.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8b7d5a98-429a-4c78-a060-171177b3163c\">Someone explained it to me this way: looking at what Niramax was charging companies for taking away their waste. There is no way it could have charged that rate if it was paying the full landfill tax charge. Likewise, how could it be economically viable to transport waste from a council in south Wales to the north-east? It was quite a big operation, and certain local companies went out of business because they were being undercut by Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"51aab884-2bfb-4646-88a4-ce5540eb783f\">Three regional police forces, Durham, Cleveland and Northumbria, had contracts with Niramax, which shows how big the business got. If anyone had looked at the directors of the company and seen their backgrounds, I would have thought it would have rung a few alarm bells with those three police authorities and made them ask why on earth they were giving a contract to that company.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"bacd5fe4-af78-456e-9455-bec691a96284\">After a few years of badgering, HMRC took action and Nosedive was launched, with a great deal of publicity, in 2014 with a raid of Niramax's headquarters in Hartlepool. £250,000 in cash was found under somebody's desk and a lot of documents were taken. To quote the Teesside Live newspaper at the time:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ca4566e3-ecd1-415f-9c1f-8cc599ae97fd\">\"Simon York, Fraud Investigation Service director at HMRC, said: 'This is the culmination of 18 months' painstaking investigation into the suspected systematic abuse of the landfill tax system. We believe that over £78m revenue may be involved, money which could be used to fund some of the UK 's most vital public services.'\"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2b7570ff-9bbf-4225-b5ab-e138dc50a13d\">That is £78 million for one operator. I thought, \"Great!\" when that happened, and so did people I know in the industry, but six years down the line a journalist rang me and said, \"Do you know they've actually dropped the Operation Nosedive prosecution?\". Nothing happened, but HMRC spent £3.5 million of public money on the investigation.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"08f7edf3-3712-49b4-bb31-c9f5b0444fad\">I tried to find out how much that investigation cost; I know my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon tried too, but HMRC would not tell us. We only found out because the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and I got the National Audit Office to do an investigation into it. There is a fundamental question of accountability here. Before the Minister tells me that we cannot have control over HMRC, I agree with him, but there is a lack of accountability in this situation if I or Parliament cannot ask why public money is being spent in that way.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ec31b720-7595-4c0e-ade4-9b492144d719\">Operation Nosedive was a complete failure and Niramax got away with the fraud-and that £78 million is just one organisation. The other point is that Niramax was not the only operator using that landfill site or the other sites it owned. Other operators were using them too, which raises the question who else was in on the scam and who else was not paying full landfill tax, because I suspect others were at it as well.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8cf6e04b-3697-4365-94cf-fdd92894539d\">The strange thing is that one of the main directors of Niramax is currently in prison-it has nothing to do with this situation, but rather with a very nasty murder case in Hartlepool. Were people surprised when he was found to have been involved in that situation or found guilty? No, they were not, but why are people with criminal records allowed to run those industries? Because they are making money. That is just one case.</p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>","Date":{"Year":2023,"Month":1,"MonthShort":"Jan","Day":12},"SourceIds":["59935148-50b3-4c9c-a1aa-8b7d1c605b41","2a42a737-28ec-41b7-ae8b-1c7f96adf1d9"]},{"FtaDoc":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n<div data-section-id = \"f9e817d7-4c6d-46f0-bd80-268de5f76a6a\">\n<h1 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"f2bd4809-2a4e-43ee-9127-c48aabb21e67\">Yes, and I will come on to such an...: 12 Jan 2023: House of Commons debates</h1>\n<h2 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"61baef2d-537c-49ca-80ed-233fd8db8a0c\">Part of the debate - in the House of Commons at 2:37 pm 12 January 2023</h2>\n<p data-text-id = \"0820e46a-c2a5-4302-aadd-868e205c2527\">Yes, and I will come on to such an example in a minute.

If anyone had looked at the directors of the company and seen their backgrounds, I would have thought it would have rung a few alarm bells with those three police authorities and made them ask why on earth they were giving a contract to that company.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"bacd5fe4-af78-456e-9455-bec691a96284\">After a few years of badgering, HMRC took action and Nosedive was launched, with a great deal of publicity, in 2014 with a raid of Niramax's headquarters in Hartlepool. £250,000 in cash was found under somebody's desk and a lot of documents were taken. To quote the Teesside Live newspaper at the time:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ca4566e3-ecd1-415f-9c1f-8cc599ae97fd\">\"Simon York, Fraud Investigation Service director at HMRC, said: 'This is the culmination of 18 months' painstaking investigation into the suspected systematic abuse of the landfill tax system. We believe that over £78m revenue may be involved, money which could be used to fund some of the UK 's most vital public services.'\"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2b7570ff-9bbf-4225-b5ab-e138dc50a13d\">That is £78 million for one operator. I thought, \"Great!\" when that happened, and so did people I know in the industry, but six years down the line a journalist rang me and said, \"Do you know they've actually dropped the Operation Nosedive prosecution?\". Nothing happened, but HMRC spent £3.5 million of public money on the investigation.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"08f7edf3-3712-49b4-bb31-c9f5b0444fad\">I tried to find out how much that investigation cost; I know my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon tried too, but HMRC would not tell us. We only found out because the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and I got the National Audit Office to do an investigation into it. There is a fundamental question of accountability here. Before the Minister tells me that we cannot have control over HMRC, I agree with him, but there is a lack of accountability in this situation if I or Parliament cannot ask why public money is being spent in that way.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ec31b720-7595-4c0e-ade4-9b492144d719\">Operation Nosedive was a complete failure and Niramax got away with the fraud-and that £78 million is just one organisation. The other point is that Niramax was not the only operator using that landfill site or the other sites it owned. Other operators were using them too, which raises the question who else was in on the scam and who else was not paying full landfill tax, because I suspect others were at it as well.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8cf6e04b-3697-4365-94cf-fdd92894539d\">The strange thing is that one of the main directors of Niramax is currently in prison-it has nothing to do with this situation, but rather with a very nasty murder case in Hartlepool. Were people surprised when he was found to have been involved in that situation or found guilty? No, they were not, but why are people with criminal records allowed to run those industries? Because they are making money. That is just one case.</p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>","Date":{"Year":2023,"Month":1,"MonthShort":"Jan","Day":12},"SourceIds":["59935148-50b3-4c9c-a1aa-8b7d1c605b41","2a42a737-28ec-41b7-ae8b-1c7f96adf1d9"]},{"FtaDoc":"<!DOCTYPE

An appeal was launched on the basis of the defendant's advice provided in conference on 20 April 2011. The defendant then settled the papers for the appeal under a covering email dated 4 May 2011 explaining the claimant had a reasonable prospect of success.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fdb23f1c-786e-4da4-ae2e-221a56792331\">On 26 October 2011, the defendant sent his written advice on the merits of the claim explaining that the claimant had a 55-60% prospect of success. A deputy judge rejected the claimant's argument and the property was sold.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"99a8d67f-5ce3-4d2a-9120-587f78d976d7\">The claimant subsequently brought a claim for professional negligence against the defendant.

It was held that the April and May 2011 advice did not render the claim in respect of the October 2011 advice out of time. The October 2011 advice could be treated separately, and the claim based on that advice was therefore not statute-barred.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5ce9d0c2-0e28-444f-a17a-6ca8d3e1da5f\">Coulson LJ said \" it seems to me that any alleged negligence in October 2011 was different in nature and extent to any prior negligence in April/May.

This policy was underwritten by a junior employee who used a \"commoditised and streamlined\" process involving three inputs: the amount of the cover, the nature of the trade and the claims experience. When entering these variables the employee incorrectly categorised the risk, causing the premium to be incorrect with a very low policy excess.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"71fd1cbe-9fc7-47df-adac-55d9d9e1c63c\">On 4 December 2015 a fire broke out at Niramax's main premises, destroying approximately £4.5million of machine and equipment, including the Eggersman plant. Upon notification, Zurich reserved its right to avoid the policy on the basis that Niramax had failed to disclose the special terms imposed by Millennium.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"adc0a9e2-632c-46bf-b454-bfe351096508\">At first instance, the court held that there had been a material non-disclosure which was not causative of the mistake by Zurich's employee. Zurich may therefore have declined to insure the Eggersman plant, but the court did not accept that it would have cancelled the policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2630bdc0-f568-4ca4-8508-025c99b44865\">Niramax appealed to the Court of Appeal who dismissed the appeal on the basis that Zurich did not take independent account of the risk when calculating the premium. The employee's mistake was therefore the sole cause of the lower premium, meaning the undisclosed facts would not have had any causative effect on the renewal being written on cheaper terms.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"89d981c0-c677-4ad6-afaf-da953fa826a2\">This outcome emphasises the need for insurers to have clear processes, which show when decisions are made and by whom.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"53c0fb40-a346-4477-b30a-961dce4f3979\">Contacts: Matt Deaville, Fleur Rochester and Sarah Hitchcock</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"03cf63f6-edad-43a7-919a-93166e106316\">Related item: Material non-disclosure was not an \"efficient cause\" of different policy terms in Court of Appeal case</p>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"14ae528e-9fca-4446-9321-759defbb789a\">Mis-selling claim against mortgage brokers dismissed by courts</h4>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"b66ebd88-a6e0-45b2-bf12-93d8035604e8\">Collett v SPF Private Clients [21.04.21]</h4>\n<p data-text-id = \"42a934bf-da24-43be-9c8e-1b22b724e93d\">In 2005, Mr and Mrs Collett (the claimants) sought mortgage advice from SPF Private Clients Ltd (the defendant) to purchase a house. The advice culminated in the defendant advising the claimants to part-exchange their current property in order to enter into a regulated mortgage which was repayable on an interest only basis over a period of 20 years.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6798bba7-c0d6-4656-81e6-eb3904c4597e\">The claimants brought a claim against the defendant in April 2020, shortly before the 15 year longstop limitation date. They asserted the defendant advised the claimants to enter into an interest only mortgage when a repayment mortgage would have been more affordable. The defendant also allegedly failed to advise them that they would need a suitable repayment vehicle to fund the repayment of the mortgage at the end of the term.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"19be2431-f688-4a5d-933c-dfcf08ccdc74\">The claimants sought to rely on the secondary limitation period (three years from date of knowledge). They asserted that they only acquired the relevant knowledge on seeing adverts on social media about mortgage mis-selling in August 2018 and realised that a repayment mortgage may have been available to them in 2005.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"72f816cd-7032-445f-8fa9-5e7ef04dfb03\">The judge granted summary judgment in favour of the defendant. He found that the warnings provided in the mortgage offers and statements were sufficient to give the claimants constructive knowledge for the purposes of limitation. The judge also found that any individual should understand that he will be required to pay more interest on the entire capital sum in an interest only mortgage than on a reducing capital sum in a repayment mortgage.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"46a19bf9-d4ff-40e6-81ac-d66cc7c86749\">Most claims brought against brokers for mis-selling interest only mortgages are brought well outside the primary limitation period and previous attempts to strike out claims on similar grounds have been unsuccessful. This decision therefore marks a welcome change for defendant mortgage brokers.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3fdfa3b2-e4f0-48fc-833a-7f212b5913f6\">Contacts: Matt Deaville, Caterina Yandell, Andrew Hogan and William Finnerty</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"59fab802-44e0-4446-8b76-6009c0583423\">Related item: Mortgage mis-selling claim struck out on limitation: a significant victory for mortgage brokers</p>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"ac69efa2-6ab1-467d-8b40-54a12751f7e8\">Referrals from the unregulated: A warning to SIPP providers</h4>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"f1742123-8a5a-4bd3-be1f-97c9990006ba\">Adams v Options UK Personal Pensions LLP & ORS [01.04.21]</h4>\n<p data-text-id = \"25a2f5d2-9807-4429-9891-846cbfc92c30\">Mr Adams moved funds from his pension into a SIPP which was operated by Care Pensions UK LLP (Carey). Mr Adams was introduced to Carey by an unregulated introducer named CL & P Brokers Socieded Limitada (CLP). The SIPP was used to purchase nonstandard investments in income-generating store pods (storage units). However the investments proved to be unsuccessful and made a loss. Mr Adam's claim to the High Court was unsuccessful. The Court of Appeal (CA) considered two of Mr Adams' allegations in detail: whether Carey breached s.27 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and/or COBS 2.1.1R of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"03db2b95-085a-4e4b-9c5f-54d600402621\">Mr Adams alleged that CLP had breached FSMA's general prohibition under s.19 by arranging deals and advising on his investment, as an unauthorised person. Mr Adams also alleged that he entered the SIPP with Carey as a result of this and that it should be unenforceable under s.27 FSMA. The CA considered that Mr Adams had entered into a \"relevant investment\" to which the regulatory regime applied and that CLP did \"advise on\" his investment that the investment was made \"in consequence\" of that. The appeal was allowed on these grounds.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"eb016648-813f-48e9-beba-be8d32be10d1\">However, Mr Adams' claim that Carey breached the FCA handbook was dismissed. In the High Court, Mr Adams had argued that Carey breached rule 2.1.1R by establishing a SIPP and administrating on a \"manifestly unsuitable\" investment. The CA found that Mr Adams had attempted to radically amend his particulars of claim to the extent of putting forward a new case and the claim was dismissed.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9d894262-3bca-4955-a4b7-3c2ecd3dc607\">The judgment provides a useful warning to SIPP providers who choose to accept business referrals from unregulated introducers. Of course, it will be likely to have limited impact on those only dealing with regulated introducers.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a75681b2-9750-4f44-821b-b9be8c026ff2\">Contacts: Helen Ager, Fleur Rochester, Henry Saunders and Harry James</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d84b8be8-df9f-4832-a351-993339a754ab\">Related item: SIPP providers and unregulated introducers: the story continues</p>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"b03158fb-ed7f-4906-bce6-cc572a1b3dbf\">The many allegations that can be lodged against a director</h4>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"939bc2d4-658b-43ba-bb23-ad8264a3bda1\">Biscoe and Baxter as Joint Liquidators of Equitable Law Capital Limited v Milner & others [30.03.21]</h4>\n<p data-text-id = \"c9067b44-3c0e-4dd9-af0a-525806aa18c3\">The applicants were joint liquidators of Equitable Law Capital Limited (ELC). ELC ran an investment scheme, funding claims against financial institutions for mis-selling of bonds. Investors would contribute capital which ELC would use to fund the mis-selling claims. With successful mis-selling claims, the claimant would receive compensation, less a success fee, which would be shared between ELC and a claims management company, with the investor receiving a fixed return. If the claim failed, the loss of the investment would be covered by insurance. The scheme ultimately was unsuccessful, with investors paying over £3 million, and receiving returns of just over £200,000. As a result, ELC with its lack of working capital was put into insolvent liquidation.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"672308aa-2fb1-457b-b505-cac2e774855e\">It was alleged that there were serious misrepresentations in the brochure presented by ELC to investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent and wrongful trading by directors and breaches of directors' duties.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"27aa4268-10f5-4897-b991-5f4240837646\">The first and second respondents were, respectively, actual and de facto directors of ELC. The claims against them were settled by way of settlement agreement.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7f84f8fc-2cba-495b-9088-615ebaba0d8a\">The third respondent, who was a consultant to the scheme, was deemed to be a de facto director of ELC and was held liable for fraudulent trading under the Insolvency Act 1986 s.213. The court found that with regard to wrongful trading allegations under s.214 of the 1986 Act, there was no requirement to show that the loss would not have been suffered if the person had complied with their duties. Instead, a causative link between the continuation of trading and an increase in the deficiency to creditors needed to be proved, which it was in this case. Furthermore, since he was a de facto director, the third respondent also owed ELC statutory duties under the Companies Act 2006 and was held to have breached those duties.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"467c4afa-ec12-49bf-8a13-23523a351c5c\">Interestingly, as regards the settlement agreement for the claims against the first and second respondents, the court noted that where there was a joint cause of action against more than one person, a discharge of one of them operated as a discharge of all.

An appeal was launched on the basis of the defendant's advice provided in conference on 20 April 2011. The defendant then settled the papers for the appeal under a covering email dated 4 May 2011 explaining the claimant had a reasonable prospect of success.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fdb23f1c-786e-4da4-ae2e-221a56792331\">On 26 October 2011, the defendant sent his written advice on the merits of the claim explaining that the claimant had a 55-60% prospect of success. A deputy judge rejected the claimant's argument and the property was sold.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"99a8d67f-5ce3-4d2a-9120-587f78d976d7\">The claimant subsequently brought a claim for professional negligence against the defendant.

It was held that the April and May 2011 advice did not render the claim in respect of the October 2011 advice out of time. The October 2011 advice could be treated separately, and the claim based on that advice was therefore not statute-barred.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5ce9d0c2-0e28-444f-a17a-6ca8d3e1da5f\">Coulson LJ said \" it seems to me that any alleged negligence in October 2011 was different in nature and extent to any prior negligence in April/May.

This policy was underwritten by a junior employee who used a \"commoditised and streamlined\" process involving three inputs: the amount of the cover, the nature of the trade and the claims experience. When entering these variables the employee incorrectly categorised the risk, causing the premium to be incorrect with a very low policy excess.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"71fd1cbe-9fc7-47df-adac-55d9d9e1c63c\">On 4 December 2015 a fire broke out at Niramax's main premises, destroying approximately £4.5million of machine and equipment, including the Eggersman plant. Upon notification, Zurich reserved its right to avoid the policy on the basis that Niramax had failed to disclose the special terms imposed by Millennium.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"adc0a9e2-632c-46bf-b454-bfe351096508\">At first instance, the court held that there had been a material non-disclosure which was not causative of the mistake by Zurich's employee. Zurich may therefore have declined to insure the Eggersman plant, but the court did not accept that it would have cancelled the policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2630bdc0-f568-4ca4-8508-025c99b44865\">Niramax appealed to the Court of Appeal who dismissed the appeal on the basis that Zurich did not take independent account of the risk when calculating the premium. The employee's mistake was therefore the sole cause of the lower premium, meaning the undisclosed facts would not have had any causative effect on the renewal being written on cheaper terms.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"89d981c0-c677-4ad6-afaf-da953fa826a2\">This outcome emphasises the need for insurers to have clear processes, which show when decisions are made and by whom.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"53c0fb40-a346-4477-b30a-961dce4f3979\">Contacts: Matt Deaville, Fleur Rochester and Sarah Hitchcock</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"03cf63f6-edad-43a7-919a-93166e106316\">Related item: Material non-disclosure was not an \"efficient cause\" of different policy terms in Court of Appeal case</p>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"14ae528e-9fca-4446-9321-759defbb789a\">Mis-selling claim against mortgage brokers dismissed by courts</h4>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"b66ebd88-a6e0-45b2-bf12-93d8035604e8\">Collett v SPF Private Clients [21.04.21]</h4>\n<p data-text-id = \"42a934bf-da24-43be-9c8e-1b22b724e93d\">In 2005, Mr and Mrs Collett (the claimants) sought mortgage advice from SPF Private Clients Ltd (the defendant) to purchase a house. The advice culminated in the defendant advising the claimants to part-exchange their current property in order to enter into a regulated mortgage which was repayable on an interest only basis over a period of 20 years.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6798bba7-c0d6-4656-81e6-eb3904c4597e\">The claimants brought a claim against the defendant in April 2020, shortly before the 15 year longstop limitation date. They asserted the defendant advised the claimants to enter into an interest only mortgage when a repayment mortgage would have been more affordable. The defendant also allegedly failed to advise them that they would need a suitable repayment vehicle to fund the repayment of the mortgage at the end of the term.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"19be2431-f688-4a5d-933c-dfcf08ccdc74\">The claimants sought to rely on the secondary limitation period (three years from date of knowledge). They asserted that they only acquired the relevant knowledge on seeing adverts on social media about mortgage mis-selling in August 2018 and realised that a repayment mortgage may have been available to them in 2005.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"72f816cd-7032-445f-8fa9-5e7ef04dfb03\">The judge granted summary judgment in favour of the defendant. He found that the warnings provided in the mortgage offers and statements were sufficient to give the claimants constructive knowledge for the purposes of limitation. The judge also found that any individual should understand that he will be required to pay more interest on the entire capital sum in an interest only mortgage than on a reducing capital sum in a repayment mortgage.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"46a19bf9-d4ff-40e6-81ac-d66cc7c86749\">Most claims brought against brokers for mis-selling interest only mortgages are brought well outside the primary limitation period and previous attempts to strike out claims on similar grounds have been unsuccessful.

Mr Adams was introduced to Carey by an unregulated introducer named CL & P Brokers Socieded Limitada (CLP). The SIPP was used to purchase nonstandard investments in income-generating store pods (storage units). However the investments proved to be unsuccessful and made a loss. Mr Adam's claim to the High Court was unsuccessful. The Court of Appeal (CA) considered two of Mr Adams' allegations in detail: whether Carey breached s.27 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and/or COBS 2.1.1R of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"03db2b95-085a-4e4b-9c5f-54d600402621\">Mr Adams alleged that CLP had breached FSMA's general prohibition under s.19 by arranging deals and advising on his investment, as an unauthorised person. Mr Adams also alleged that he entered the SIPP with Carey as a result of this and that it should be unenforceable under s.27 FSMA. The CA considered that Mr Adams had entered into a \"relevant investment\" to which the regulatory regime applied and that CLP did \"advise on\" his investment that the investment was made \"in consequence\" of that. The appeal was allowed on these grounds.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"eb016648-813f-48e9-beba-be8d32be10d1\">However, Mr Adams' claim that Carey breached the FCA handbook was dismissed. In the High Court, Mr Adams had argued that Carey breached rule 2.1.1R by establishing a SIPP and administrating on a \"manifestly unsuitable\" investment. The CA found that Mr Adams had attempted to radically amend his particulars of claim to the extent of putting forward a new case and the claim was dismissed.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9d894262-3bca-4955-a4b7-3c2ecd3dc607\">The judgment provides a useful warning to SIPP providers who choose to accept business referrals from unregulated introducers.

ELC ran an investment scheme, funding claims against financial institutions for mis-selling of bonds. Investors would contribute capital which ELC would use to fund the mis-selling claims. With successful mis-selling claims, the claimant would receive compensation, less a success fee, which would be shared between ELC and a claims management company, with the investor receiving a fixed return. If the claim failed, the loss of the investment would be covered by insurance. The scheme ultimately was unsuccessful, with investors paying over £3 million, and receiving returns of just over £200,000. As a result, ELC with its lack of working capital was put into insolvent liquidation.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"672308aa-2fb1-457b-b505-cac2e774855e\">It was alleged that there were serious misrepresentations in the brochure presented by ELC to investors, as well as allegations of fraudulent and wrongful trading by directors and breaches of directors' duties.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"27aa4268-10f5-4897-b991-5f4240837646\">The first and second respondents were, respectively, actual and de facto directors of ELC. The claims against them were settled by way of settlement agreement.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7f84f8fc-2cba-495b-9088-615ebaba0d8a\">The third respondent, who was a consultant to the scheme, was deemed to be a de facto director of ELC and was held liable for fraudulent trading under the Insolvency Act 1986 s.213. The court found that with regard to wrongful trading allegations under s.214 of the 1986 Act, there was no requirement to show that the loss would not have been suffered if the person had complied with their duties. Instead, a causative link between the continuation of trading and an increase in the deficiency to creditors needed to be proved, which it was in this case. Furthermore, since he was a de facto director, the third respondent also owed ELC statutory duties under the Companies Act 2006 and was held to have breached those duties.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"467c4afa-ec12-49bf-8a13-23523a351c5c\">Interestingly, as regards the settlement agreement for the claims against the first and second respondents, the court noted that where there was a joint cause of action against more than one person, a discharge of one of them operated as a discharge of all. However, a covenant not to sue one joint tortfeasor did not have the same result. Furthermore, the authorities did not apply against concurrent tortfeasors (i.e. persons liable for separate torts that combine to produce the same damage).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a8ad1d80-94e6-41d6-8d58-eb401298dcfd\">The many claims lodged against the directors (both actual and de facto) in this case highlights the need for directors to be aware of the position of responsibility they hold.

By 4 October the dredger UKD ORCA had completed ten days of routine dredging, overseen by the harbour authority PD Ports. The ORCA removed 148,000 tonnes of sediment from the river mouth and dumped it 2.5 miles off the Redcar coast. The next day, dead crustaceans started to wash up on the shore.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fcacf5db-814a-4849-87f7-3686f67f4f21\">This September sees more radical dredging in preparation for the new Freeport infrastructure, when two million tonnes of sediment will be removed.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"d08f2529-c29d-4574-a61a-83a33a4908cc\">Levels of pyridine</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"7cdc4ea0-e1e1-464e-804d-7e8dd6bb3e3f\">An expert report commissioned by the Whitby Fishermen's Association rejected the algae theory.

However, they did not review chemical companies that use pyridine in their processes, like Vertellus or Fine Organics, both at Seal Sands near the mouth of the Tees. Nor did they check the effluent data of Northumbrian Water which treats Vertellus' waste and disposes of it in the Tees. Vertellus decommissioned its Seal Sands plant in October last year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f9dd37db-dbf5-412c-adf0-46a1a5dd6233\">Pyridine has a myriad industrial applications including as an ingredient in pesticides and pharmaceuticals.

This was not that time-honoured trip to catch the last rays of summer sun, and they left their buckets and spades at home. They were there to hold a beach protest at government inaction over the mass die-off of crabs, lobsters, and other sea creatures along the North East coast.</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"0e1ed4ea-7ff9-4bea-bc54-907cc160a874\">It was October 2021 when waves of crustaceans washed up on the beaches from Sunderland to Whitby, forming piles of dead and dying sea life, waist-deep in places. The dead also included the apex predators - seals and porpoise The marine catastrophe was echoed in similar, smaller events in February and May this year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d509b11f-ee70-4299-901b-ace6508a3dbd\">An investigation by the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) blamed a bloom of algae. A suspicious shadow on satellite images was their proof.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"8223415e-e4e5-41ae-88ec-56b18ed30306\">Dredging</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"dee75757-40ea-4bb1-829a-7de78c9dab78\">Residents and fishermen were not convinced, however, pointing a finger at the dredging of the River Tees that took place in the days before the first die-off. By 4 October the dredger UKD ORCA had completed ten days of routine dredging, overseen by the harbour authority PD Ports. The ORCA removed 148,000 tonnes of sediment from the river mouth and dumped it 2.5 miles off the Redcar coast. The next day, dead crustaceans started to wash up on the shore.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fcacf5db-814a-4849-87f7-3686f67f4f21\">This September sees more radical dredging in preparation for the new Freeport infrastructure, when two million tonnes of sediment will be removed.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"d08f2529-c29d-4574-a61a-83a33a4908cc\">Levels of pyridine</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"7cdc4ea0-e1e1-464e-804d-7e8dd6bb3e3f\">An expert report commissioned by the Whitby Fishermen's Association rejected the algae theory.

The beach protest is calling for a reopening of that inquiry; an independent investigation; and an overhaul of dredging controls.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"299b090b-c98f-4b8c-a059-206a8d568245\">The campaigners are also calling for a halt to dredging while a new inquiry takes place. This is the sore point for Defra and the powers behind the planned new Freeport. Tory Tees Valley Mayor, Ben Houchen has wagered his political career on the swift success of the Freeport which it is claimed will provide up to 18,000 new jobs. Or 20,000 - the claims vary.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d5b6c0af-e454-4038-afb4-d360fda66a95\">Will Houchen let waves of sealife deaths get in the way of his career?</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9cc7ff7f-e8ae-44b6-9739-38ef23c3f889\">An Environmental Information Request by the independent website OpenDemocracy revealed meeting minutes showing that Defra leaned on its researchers to focus on algae as the cause.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7ab4d5bc-2d51-417a-874a-1818f22e38af\">Defra has reported to North East Bylines that they did not research producers of pyridine as there are none in the Tees Valley. However, they did not review chemical companies that use pyridine in their processes, like Vertellus or Fine Organics, both at Seal Sands near the mouth of the Tees. Nor did they check the effluent data of Northumbrian Water which treats Vertellus' waste and disposes of it in the Tees. Vertellus decommissioned its Seal Sands plant in October last year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f9dd37db-dbf5-412c-adf0-46a1a5dd6233\">Pyridine has a myriad industrial applications including as an ingredient in pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Traditionally a by-product of coal tar manufacture, it has often been replaced by other products due to concerns over its impact on human health.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c8b92ff9-74ef-43f7-ae6d-ae899a52c448\">There are two different varieties of the chemical. Synthetic pyridine is manufactured specifically for commercial use. Organic pyridine is a waste product of the coking, iron and steel industries. It is found in slag heaps.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"8095d5d6-3338-4ef9-aca5-e8eaf8b6d264\">Slag heaps</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"303c2bb7-c2ad-4100-8828-2572df5981e2\">If we look at the Tees with one and a half centuries of iron and steel industry along its banks, how much historical organic pyridine is buried in the riverbed sediment? Slag heaps proliferated by the Tees mouth.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a6bc8339-8033-4b5e-8b36-19912f12119f\">Unfortunately for Houchen, the vast former SSI steelworks site, currently being demolished and cleaned up, is home to a range of slag hills currently being removed. Then there are the explosive demolitions of the coke ovens and the Dorman Long Tower which took place in September last year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"27e5fc8e-1448-410d-8119-3d5ff4f87788\">The North East is spoiled for choice when it comes to slag heaps. A cliff at Seaham, Sunderland, collapsed in May last year. The cliff at Chemical Beach is actually an old slag heap and sea currents could have washed the debris southwards to the die-off zone.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"62be3d8f-f11a-444b-848f-83fa022d5e0f\">Defra could also have investigated other possibilities: gasses from underground mines being just one example. The Durham Coalfield stretches under the North Sea and old mineworkings extend for miles under the seabed.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"18a48e59-77f9-4bfa-85f3-6360a2d72b90\">There's also the illegal dumping and simply unknown old contamination.

Are we witnessing the outcome of an unknown pollutant? Are the Defra testing protocols up to date for Teesside's chemical industry cluster which offers a range of novel specialty chemicals? Is the monitoring of historical pollution fit for purpose and what efforts are being made to clean up the most poisoned waterway in Britain?</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a19803d2-c707-4e8a-b6cb-81d069b3cbe2\">All this leads us to ask: what can kill seabed-dwelling crustaceans with no warning and at such a scale?</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"570e60d6-6223-4ec0-8934-83d693ad1a35\">As yet no-one has the answer.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"11253825-8d1d-441b-8427-3dfee44043e2\">Human chain protest</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"68a7ede9-7305-4956-97de-58418cfe7da1\">On beach after beach the protesters on Sunday linked hands in a human chain and the organisers - Facebook group Reclaim Our Sea - vowed to press ahead with their campaign.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5106c6fa-2b55-4423-8f18-6e67257dc695\">Co-organiser Alison Pake, a seal rescuer and ocean activist in Sunderland said:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8d09dae1-e4ce-49b4-aacb-d25f80c647ec\">\"It was awesome.

All counsel were from 4 New Square. The insured was represented by Ben Elkington QC and Ben Smiley, and insurers were represented by Graham Eklund QC and Carl Troman. The Court's decision is considered by John Williams of 4 New Square.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"5762a8c1-8982-4927-a34e-e2749da30dc2\">The facts</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"434cb766-b1b7-4c0b-89e7-0cb665aca6ec\">Niramax collected and recycled waste. Its main premises (the recycling facility) were located at Thomlinson Road, Hartlepool. Niramax also processed tyres at sites on Tofts Road, Hartlepool, and ran a waste transfer station in the nearby town of Washington (\" the Washington Site \"). Prior to 2007, part of this waste processing business was run by SWS - a separate subsidiary of Niramax's parent company, \"NHL\". Niramax purchased the business of SWS in 2007, and from then on ran the business across all four sites.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8544d857-850e-4610-ab84-91e75d45cc2a\">SWS and Niramax held a suite of insurance policies with Zurich, which covered a variety of risks relating to its plant and machinery. One was a contractor's plant policy (\" the Policy \"), which provided all risks cover for mobile plant. The policy originally incepted in 2006, and was renewed thereafter, up to and including the 2014-15 policy year. Niramax placed buildings cover separately with a variety of underwriters.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a1c93d0b-d854-4d9a-b855-15972ce9ed9f\">Significantly for the purposes of Niramax's claim, in 2015 it placed an order for the Eggersmann plant; which was due to arrive before the end of the 2015 policy year. Niramax requested that Zurich extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant. Zurich was reluctant (for reasons discussed further below). However, after a lengthy back and forth between Zurich's underwriting team and Niramax's broker, a Mr Sweeney, Zurich agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant from September 2015 until the renewal date of the Policy in mid-December - on the payment of an additional premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a27ae2d5-d152-4085-918b-c18882a34559\">On 4 December 2015, a fire broke out in the engine compartment of a \"grabber\" at the Thomlinson Road site. This was extinguished promptly - but staff failed to notice that burning embers had spread to a neighbouring building, which housed the Eggersmann plant. It was destroyed, along with other items of machinery.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f7cabe5d-185c-4b42-9a11-324ae2ca0616\">Niramax made a claim under the Policy which, at trial, was valued at around £4.5 million. The majority of this claim related to the loss of the Eggersmann plant, which it valued at around £4.3 million. Zurich refused to pay, and stated that it was entitled to avoid the Policy for material non-disclosure and misrepresentation. Niramax then brought proceedings in the High Court.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"4999298a-d140-4ce8-810f-24253fd3ebe4\">Niramax's buildings insurance</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"7b5b2259-865d-4650-9771-7d3ddffd0aba\">Zurich's primary defence at trial was that there had been material non-disclosure of facts relating to Niramax's buildings cover.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2c23e000-8a9e-42b1-8f2f-9d12e92778af\">For the 2010/11 policy year, Niramax's buildings cover was placed with Paladin, which subsequently withdrew from the market. From 2011 to 2014, cover was placed through a Lloyd's broker (Mr Smith) with a variety of underwriters. For the 2014/15 year, Niramax's underwriters did not offer renewal terms, and Mr Sweeney sought quotes from Mr Smith, and \"Recyclesure\" - a company specialising in recycling industry risks. Recyclesure provided the more competitive quote, for a policy with Millennium Insurance (\" Millennium \"), and this was accepted by Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6c0e545b-b050-4eec-82b1-3a5a12f9f5bc\">Millennium's quote was subject to survey, which took place in February 2014. Mr Sweeney was subsequently sent a report detailing a number of \" risk requirements \". Three risk requirements (an automatic fire detection system, CCTV cameras and hot-spot checking procedures) related to the Washington Road site. Seven risk requirements related to Thomlinson Road - one of which was: \" 3 x fixed Shredders within Black Sand Building: It is necessary to protect shredders by means of an automatic Fire Suppression System. Timescale: within 30 days of survey (by 16 March 14) \".</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"95177560-e772-4a96-a119-b61ff92039f4\">Throughout 2014 Direct Insurance (on behalf of Millennium) sent chasers to Mr Sweeney asking for updates on the installation of the fire suppression system at Thomlinson Road. This culminated in Millennium imposing special terms on 22 October 2014: the excess under the Millennium Policy was increased to £250,000 per claim, and Niramax was required to self-insure for 35% of the balance of any loss. Notwithstanding this, no fire suppression system was installed before the end of the policy year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91e7adea-548e-455e-a7fd-71db8e181c58\">In December 2014, Niramax sought a renewal quote from Millennium, and a number of other placing brokers, including Mr Smith. Millennium offered renewal terms on the basis of an installation of fire suppression systems at Thomlinson Road, but did not offer cover for Washington Road. A quotation was also provided by Aspen via Mr Smith. Niramax completed proposal forms for Aspen, which included a denial by Niramax that it had ever been subject to special terms imposed by an insurer. This was plainly incorrect, given the history of the Millennium policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"82659547-dedf-4af9-9297-bb61dac29331\">The Aspen quote was accepted, and Aspen were on risk for the 2015/16 policy year.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"2b722628-0d8d-49a2-bdb6-c16427930e7f\">Niramax's Policy</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"78a871e1-47a8-4214-98a9-ead0b01ac07c\">The Policy which formed the basis for Niramax's claim (the contractor's plant policy) originally incepted in 2006, with SWS as the insured. Niramax was added as an insured in 2007/08. The Policy provided all risks cover for loss or damage to owned and hired-in mobile plant. The Policy was renewed with Zurich on broadly similar terms in subsequent years, up to and including the 2014/15 policy year. For 2014/15, the premium was £23,714.40 - an increase of 20% on the previous year. The premium was, despite this increase, below what should have been offered due to the use of an incorrect multiplier.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"161978e8-6cca-43ad-a244-dba04cc7fb0d\">In mid-2015, mindful of the arrival of the Eggersmann plant, Niramax (through Mr Sweeney) requested that Zurich add the Eggersmann plant to the Policy. Initially, Zurich refused to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant as it was fixed plant, and the Policy only covered mobile plant. It was suggested that the new machinery should instead be covered under Niramax's property policy. Mr Sweeney persisted, and eventually Zurich agreed to cover the Eggersmann plant until the date of renewal of the Policy in December 2015 - subject to conditions including:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f86373ae-5b11-417c-a2b5-49846a595e07\">An increase in the excess under the Policy from £500 to £10,000.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7776e1b8-66c9-4a5d-bdd8-01f46f41cc3c\">A \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6c66ea07-2ad0-4520-aea6-12b954d7d6b7\">trouble free running in period</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"87c8b7a8-da95-4261-bb2a-ebaab0ce27c1\">\" of 30 days.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"23d8080d-4ef3-40dc-bc87-c5666d8de9eb\">An increased premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c70df788-4fa3-45d1-8a8f-7ba674aa843b\">The fire occurred prior to renewal on 4 December 2015, and on renewal, Zurich declined to cover Niramax's fixed plant under the Policy.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"22a38f51-a834-4526-8094-79f1c166ddbc\">Niramax's Case, and Zurich's Defence</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"e500ec33-d450-4817-a637-c19a47f1a7ec\">Throughout, Niramax argued that it was entitled to an indemnity under the Policy.

At the time of avoidance, Zurich put its case as follows [125]-[130]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"69f3e28d-8ae7-440f-a440-ce988c8fe63c\">It contended that Niramax had failed to disclose five material circumstances. In particular, Zurich advanced the \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b1a4df41-aa1b-4b6c-817e-87ccdb11fc06\">\": an allegation that Mr Shaun Morfitt, who had been imprisoned for a serious criminal offence in 2010, was a shadow director of Niramax; and that his conviction should therefore have been disclosed to Zurich.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"96270a38-7783-4829-9ed2-48cf9868552a\">Zurich asserted that Niramax was in breach of conditions precedent under the Policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"dcd67c4e-affc-431c-b9df-8ce16f1a19a8\">Zurich later dropped the Morfitt Defence, and the breach of conditions defence.

On this basis, Zurich sought to avoid its obligations to indemnify Niramax, in whole or in part.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"9305abf2-6b0b-44ba-a795-b4e832b192d3\">Applicable legal principles</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"58e531a6-99c3-4792-aa5c-046799239a52\">It is for the party pleading non-disclosure (here, Zurich) to show that the relevant matter was \"material\" to the decision to write the risk. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 (\" the 1906 Act \") states that an insured must \" disclose to the insurer, before the contract is concluded, every material circumstance which is known to the assured, and the assured is deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known to him \" (s 18). A fact is material if it would \" influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the premium, or determining whether he will take the risk \" (s 18(2)).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"abf2f25d-db48-4492-b70f-3a1ffb803a05\">The judgment cited a number of further principles relevant to materiality, relying on the decisions of Carr J in Brit UW Ltd v F & B Trenchless Solutions Ltd [2016] Lloyd's Rep IR 69, and Leggatt J in Involnert Management v Aprilgrange Ltd [2015] 2 Lloyd's Rep 289 [133.iii]. These include the need for courts to take an objective approach to assessing materiality, based on the judge's independent appraisal of the alleged material circumstance in light of the facts at hand. Expert evidence is \" helpful and important to ensure that the court's findings are grounded in commercial reality \", but it is ultimately for the court to decide whether it is rational to take any particular matter into account.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"4f946623-ba27-4fa6-9e13-0792ca0fadef\">Second to materiality, Zurich had to show that any non-disclosure or misrepresentation relied on induced it to write the contract which was in fact written, on a \"but for\" basis [133.iv]. In the words of Clarke LJ in Assicurazioni Generali SpA v Arab Insurance Group [2003] 2 CLC 242 at [62]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"dbdef556-dd77-4119-803c-dbe6e17a942f\">In order to prove inducement the insurer or reinsurer must show that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was an effective cause of his entering into the contract on the terms on which he did. He must therefore show at least that, but for the relevant non-disclosure or misrepresentation, he would not have entered into the contract on those terms. On the other hand, he does not have to show that it was the sole effective cause of his doing so.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3be47a56-7c8c-447d-831b-84e9a77cc2de\">The burden for proving inducement is \" not a heavy one \" [134]. But the judge acknowledged that caution had to be exercised given that (1) avoidance is a draconian remedy which should not be lightly granted and (2) genuine evidence on inducement could nevertheless be inaccurate due to the effects of hindsight and party interest, and the difficulty of examining hypotheticals. The latter proved especially relevant given the shift in Zurich's case prior to trial.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"da7a2ea7-f809-4e05-828b-5503e46c61a7\">Zurich's Primary Defence: Risk Requirements and Special Terms</h3>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"a13dd6dd-6b9f-4652-9390-a362c437af7a\">Materiality</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"4a46b9d9-0f00-4fb5-8bf6-4f6701a0032d\">In relation to the risk requirements/special terms defence, both parties advanced expert evidence on the issue of materiality. The experts (broadly speaking) agreed that Niramax's non-compliance with risk requirements under the buildings policy, and the imposition of special terms by Millennium, were material. Those facts shone a light on Niramax's attitude to risk management, and demonstrated \" poor housekeeping \" [158]. The judge rejected an argument by Niramax that it was \" actively engaged in compliance \" during the course of 2014 - noting its \" lackadaisical \" approach to sourcing a suitable fire suppression system [141].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"e712ad5e-f830-433c-8eff-025e2832baeb\">Inducement</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"f1289451-5515-4b2c-8520-432944043e59\">The question of inducement was more complex. It raised three key preliminary issues: (1) the identity of the underwriter (2) the effect of any extra information provided if fuller disclosure had been made, and (3) the nature of the underwriting process.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b368600e-b76c-4250-9928-2fce3a8d6ce7\">First, the court had to identify which member of Zurich's underwriting team would have made the final decision on whether to offer cover (in December 2014, and September 2015), had proper disclosure been made. The judge found - in accordance with the case advanced by Zurich - that the decision would have been referred up the chain to Mr Penny, the head of its engineering risks department. It followed that \" what Mr Penny would have done \" became the crucial question when considering inducement [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ea6404ce-8726-45c6-af29-6e9d5d40e4b8\">On the second issue, the judge accepted an argument advanced by Niramax that any findings on inducement should also account for the effect on underwriters of positive information about Niramax's business practices, which would have come out if fuller disclosure had been made. However, this argument cut both ways. If a full underwriting assessment had been given, it may also have brought into play \" some less attractive features \" [192]. In the round, the judge found that a fuller presentation would not have had much effect on the overall balance of the underwriting decision.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91c5ae09-35d1-425e-8df4-29a6497e56b0\">On the third issue, the judge rejected Niramax's case that even if proper disclosure had been made, it would not have had any impact on the underwriting process [195]. Niramax based its submission on the fact that Zurich had treated the mobile plant policy in a \" commoditised and streamlined \" way [25]. There was no proposal form, and Zurich calculated premiums based only on sums insured, trade and claims experience. Niramax argued that Zurich would have done the same at the time of the 2014 renewal, even if proper disclosure had been made; but the judge found this position unpersuasive. Had proper disclosure been made, the usual process for \" vanilla \" risks would not have been followed, and underwriters would have undertaken a more detailed analysis [200].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"66b9e6e2-5740-47a4-8df9-2e8de506cfbe\">Findings</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"993be1c2-5833-4241-8c38-53b2836039ae\">That left the ultimate question - what would Mr Penny have done, if presented with the new information? The conclusion: \" it is more likely than not that if he had been aware of the facts in question Mr Penny would have reluctantly offered renewal terms in December 2014 but would have refused the extension to cover the Eggersmann plant in September 2015 \" [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2f588f32-2a1f-4f28-befd-61cc7f76d4d7\">A critical factor in Mr Penny's deliberations both in 2014 and in 2015 was the undesirability of recycling risks. In the years prior to 2013, the waste and recycling industry had come to be seen as a hazard for insurers, particularly due to fire losses [202]. In mid-2013, Mr Penny had instructed his underwriting team to stop covering fixed plant waste risks on engineering contractor's plant policies, and a 10% rate increase was subsequently levied on such risks [204]. By late 2014, the judge found that Zurich had effectively stopped writing new policies for waste risks, and was \" kicking…out \" much of its existing waste business [205]. This hostility to waste risks continued as time went on, and by the time the Eggersmann plant was added in late 2015, Mr Penny's attitude would have been even more adverse than it was at the time of renewal in December 2014 [217].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"12247f28-c3f9-4124-9247-a73672e5fa61\">In December 2014, Mr Penny would still have written the Policy - though with a higher premium to reflect the correct multiplier. This would have been done out of a sense of \" fair play \", and given the \" less than striking \" nature of the extra information which should have been disclosed [212]. On this basis, the judge found that the test for inducement was not satisfied. This was despite the factual finding that if proper disclosure had been made, the Policy would only have been written on different terms (applying the correct multiplier).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8ff97bbf-c573-4dd3-87f4-e700e5327ca3\">However, Mr Penny would not have agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann risk in 2015. As the judge found: \" By September 2015 the thinking in Zurich had moved further along the timeline of hostility to waste risks. So, the backdrop on this aspect would be no better for Niramax than it was as at December 2014, but rather worse. And at this stage we hypothesise that Mr Penny is presented with a fixed plant risk of considerable size which has no place in the mobile plant policy - as Mr Penny himself had made clear to his team in July 2013 - together with these facts relating to the risk requirements and special terms.\" [217]</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f0ecfd05-c712-41f0-8739-41e8276c364c\">When the Eggersmann plant extension was written in, after coaxing by Mr Sweeney, it was a marginal decision even without further disclosure. Had proper disclosure been given, three factors would have carried the decision \" from a very reluctant write to a polite but firm refusal \" [220]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3d5efa3e-2f5f-40c0-8dee-e12d45dbb2bd\">The impact of the information disclosed. The Eggersmann machine was a substantial item of fixed plant, which was to be underwritten without a survey. Fixed plant was inherently at greater risk than mobile plant due to its lack of mobility. Questions over Niramax's risk management in the recent past would have been enough to tip the decision into a refusal for any of Zurich's underwriters [220].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"38c9b9fe-6308-4a26-9d27-3fe50ca58f11\">Mr Penny personally was highly sensitive to the \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"de38ee24-ad87-4e01-b419-02c36d1a7b99\">direction of travel</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"51e6d1e4-87b2-43b1-8213-e0e24e1589f8\">\" in relation to waste risks [221]. He had himself set a rule that there was to be no fixed plant on waste risks, and there was no reason to think that Mr Penny would have broken his own rule in the case of Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9e9ba03b-0b0d-4eeb-be0f-22010c23a1d2\">Mr Penny came across as a \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"dc855aca-a99d-4fc7-91c8-ccc8b57b646c\">\" when giving evidence, who would have been even less willing to accommodate the client than other underwriters in Zurich's team [223]. That included Mr Hutchinson, a senior underwriter in the engineering team, who took the decision in September 2015 to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"d1f1d8aa-48e5-4b2e-9ab0-2ce0ef2c616c\">Zurich's other defences</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"7de4ec19-3d2d-4372-b4c7-e7bbaeda616a\">Given those findings, the Millennium Renewal Terms and the Aspen Defence fell away, as they only related to the 2015 extension. In any event, they would have had little or no effect on inducing Mr Penny in the circumstances of the case [228]-[230].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"87dec588-532b-45dd-9b1d-1a079a7ac7de\">On the remaining defences advanced:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e92b434d-31ff-462c-832a-8dc5367e7aff\">The Sweeney Representation Defence was unpersuasive. There was no evidence that Niramax was aware of the representations being made by Mr Sweeney, and those representations were pieces of \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5b81b57c-9dc1-4591-93e7-9e6b8a90f092\">The 2012 Fire Defence did not succeed. Its materiality was doubtful: the fire was small and at a site which was not owned, operated or insured by Niramax. In any event, Mr Penny's evidence did not suggest that it would have met the inducement hurdle [235]-[236].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"bef78c50-414d-47ba-8277-c3c4e46bccf4\">The 2006 Fine Defence was also unlikely to be material, due to the lapse of time, and the fact that it related to a different company and location - as well as given subsequent changes in management. Even if material, it would not (together or in combination with the other defences) have induced Mr Penny to refuse to write the risk or to write it on different terms [237]-[238].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fdb973d9-d000-4d2a-a4c9-c3cabd8f1848\">The Dean Fine Defence also did not meet the threshold of inducement. The conviction had been spent for over 6 months at the time of renewal, and Mr Dean was not a director of Niramax at the time of the fine or of renewal [239].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c64e68ea-1ffb-456c-8795-70b8b99e9c91\">The final point as to non-disclosure of Niramax's breach of duty for failing to disclose material facts on earlier renewals also failed. There was no evidence to show that Niramax knew that it had previously failed to disclose material circumstances - and given the above, it would also have failed on the facts [240].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"c2888d3e-3319-44d4-9c50-fdd733408385\">Quantum</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"d5d52ab5-2422-4fc4-9498-6ad83fac6390\">Zurich was ordered to return the premium received for the September extension (£32,782.62), and no indemnity was due for the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6805f11d-f0b2-4a1b-8621-f9c546b2aa4d\">Otherwise, the Policy stood, and Zurich was bound to indemnify Niramax for the items of mobile plant which were covered by the original Policy (as renewed in 2014) and damaged in the fire: two Liebherr excavators, and a Liebherr material handler. According to the Policy wording, Zurich was to pay \" the market value of the item at the time of the loss or damage \", and Zurich's internal guidance was that this meant \" the cost of a replacement item of similar age and condition \" [246].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"74084008-3785-4cc5-8747-69da999970eb\">The judge preferred the (higher) valuations of Niramax's expert (Mr Correa) of £126,000 and £127,500 for the two excavators, and £167,750 for the material handler. In part, this was due to Mr Correa's greater relevant expertise in loss adjusting, by comparison with the expert instructed by Zurich, Professor Sheldon. The judge also preferred Mr Correa's methodology [255]-[263]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6b71f3f5-45ef-4376-9972-d4d8f4873f0f\">The Sheldon valuations extrapolated from a single quoted price for each of the machines in 2019. These quotes were selected from a broader range of quoted prices, some of which were higher than those given in evidence.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9f5d9634-a22c-4444-a28d-ca63d836664d\">The Sheldon valuations took into account only foreign sales (there was no UK market for the plant), but failed to account for the cost of purchasing replacement plant in England - including transport costs, insurance and permits.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"88591453-8c9b-44e3-8118-4c8a4a30bf66\">The Sheldon calculations depreciated the items of plant (including the essentially identical excavators) at different rates for no discernible reason. The Correa valuation used the same 2.5% annual rate across each item, and this approach was deemed more credible in light of Mr Correa's expertise.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91a7c1d2-f853-462f-b230-e121a2455951\">The Correa figures cross-checked well against other reference figures - including those given by Zurich's loss adjusters Crawfords, and figures based on a 2019 valuation from Liebherr, discounted back to 2015.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e2278542-43e2-408a-b4ba-db27dfe76aa8\">Although it was not necessary given her findings on liability, the judge also preferred Niramax's valuation of the Eggersmann plant (£4,308,582) to Zurich's (£3,765,828) [249]-[254]. The machine was effectively brand new, and it was therefore appropriate to take the indemnity value as being the cost of a new replacement machine (in accordance with a subsequent quotation provided by Eggersmann).</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"ab7d824c-857d-4844-95b5-977cd92f69e1\">Comment</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"b0e500e3-e3cd-481c-baeb-4ad850f94bf9\">Non-disclosure cases turn, to a large extent, on their particular facts. But the decision in Niramax is a helpful illustration of how courts approach and apply the rules on material non-disclosure under the 1906 Act - in particular, in relation to the vexed issue of hypotheticals. Similar considerations are likely to apply to cases falling under the new provisions in Part 2 of the Insurance Act 2015.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fcafccca-563f-48dc-941c-e12349d670c4\">One contentious element of the judge's reasoning relates to her finding that the \"original\" Policy stood - even though it would not have been written on the same terms if proper disclosure had been made (because Mr Penny would have accounted for the correct multiplier as part of the premium). The judge refused permission to appeal on this ground, but her findings on inducement raise interesting questions about how the test should be applied in circumstances where the policy would in fact have only been written on different terms.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a9bcb73d-cbe6-456e-9018-2c762f70166b\">This article and the other articles in the series are not to be relied on as legal advice.

All counsel were from 4 New Square. The insured was represented by Ben Elkington QC and Ben Smiley, and insurers were represented by Graham Eklund QC and Carl Troman. The Court's decision is considered by John Williams of 4 New Square.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"5762a8c1-8982-4927-a34e-e2749da30dc2\">The facts</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"434cb766-b1b7-4c0b-89e7-0cb665aca6ec\">Niramax collected and recycled waste. Its main premises (the recycling facility) were located at Thomlinson Road, Hartlepool. Niramax also processed tyres at sites on Tofts Road, Hartlepool, and ran a waste transfer station in the nearby town of Washington (\" the Washington Site \"). Prior to 2007, part of this waste processing business was run by SWS - a separate subsidiary of Niramax's parent company, \"NHL\". Niramax purchased the business of SWS in 2007, and from then on ran the business across all four sites.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8544d857-850e-4610-ab84-91e75d45cc2a\">SWS and Niramax held a suite of insurance policies with Zurich, which covered a variety of risks relating to its plant and machinery. One was a contractor's plant policy (\" the Policy \"), which provided all risks cover for mobile plant. The policy originally incepted in 2006, and was renewed thereafter, up to and including the 2014-15 policy year. Niramax placed buildings cover separately with a variety of underwriters.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a1c93d0b-d854-4d9a-b855-15972ce9ed9f\">Significantly for the purposes of Niramax's claim, in 2015 it placed an order for the Eggersmann plant; which was due to arrive before the end of the 2015 policy year. Niramax requested that Zurich extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant. Zurich was reluctant (for reasons discussed further below). However, after a lengthy back and forth between Zurich's underwriting team and Niramax's broker, a Mr Sweeney, Zurich agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann plant from September 2015 until the renewal date of the Policy in mid-December - on the payment of an additional premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a27ae2d5-d152-4085-918b-c18882a34559\">On 4 December 2015, a fire broke out in the engine compartment of a \"grabber\" at the Thomlinson Road site. This was extinguished promptly - but staff failed to notice that burning embers had spread to a neighbouring building, which housed the Eggersmann plant. It was destroyed, along with other items of machinery.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f7cabe5d-185c-4b42-9a11-324ae2ca0616\">Niramax made a claim under the Policy which, at trial, was valued at around £4.5 million. The majority of this claim related to the loss of the Eggersmann plant, which it valued at around £4.3 million. Zurich refused to pay, and stated that it was entitled to avoid the Policy for material non-disclosure and misrepresentation. Niramax then brought proceedings in the High Court.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"4999298a-d140-4ce8-810f-24253fd3ebe4\">Niramax's buildings insurance</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"7b5b2259-865d-4650-9771-7d3ddffd0aba\">Zurich's primary defence at trial was that there had been material non-disclosure of facts relating to Niramax's buildings cover.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2c23e000-8a9e-42b1-8f2f-9d12e92778af\">For the 2010/11 policy year, Niramax's buildings cover was placed with Paladin, which subsequently withdrew from the market. From 2011 to 2014, cover was placed through a Lloyd's broker (Mr Smith) with a variety of underwriters. For the 2014/15 year, Niramax's underwriters did not offer renewal terms, and Mr Sweeney sought quotes from Mr Smith, and \"Recyclesure\" - a company specialising in recycling industry risks. Recyclesure provided the more competitive quote, for a policy with Millennium Insurance (\" Millennium \"), and this was accepted by Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6c0e545b-b050-4eec-82b1-3a5a12f9f5bc\">Millennium's quote was subject to survey, which took place in February 2014. Mr Sweeney was subsequently sent a report detailing a number of \" risk requirements \". Three risk requirements (an automatic fire detection system, CCTV cameras and hot-spot checking procedures) related to the Washington Road site. Seven risk requirements related to Thomlinson Road - one of which was: \" 3 x fixed Shredders within Black Sand Building: It is necessary to protect shredders by means of an automatic Fire Suppression System. Timescale: within 30 days of survey (by 16 March 14) \".</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"95177560-e772-4a96-a119-b61ff92039f4\">Throughout 2014 Direct Insurance (on behalf of Millennium) sent chasers to Mr Sweeney asking for updates on the installation of the fire suppression system at Thomlinson Road. This culminated in Millennium imposing special terms on 22 October 2014: the excess under the Millennium Policy was increased to £250,000 per claim, and Niramax was required to self-insure for 35% of the balance of any loss. Notwithstanding this, no fire suppression system was installed before the end of the policy year.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91e7adea-548e-455e-a7fd-71db8e181c58\">In December 2014, Niramax sought a renewal quote from Millennium, and a number of other placing brokers, including Mr Smith. Millennium offered renewal terms on the basis of an installation of fire suppression systems at Thomlinson Road, but did not offer cover for Washington Road. A quotation was also provided by Aspen via Mr Smith. Niramax completed proposal forms for Aspen, which included a denial by Niramax that it had ever been subject to special terms imposed by an insurer. This was plainly incorrect, given the history of the Millennium policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"82659547-dedf-4af9-9297-bb61dac29331\">The Aspen quote was accepted, and Aspen were on risk for the 2015/16 policy year.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"2b722628-0d8d-49a2-bdb6-c16427930e7f\">Niramax's Policy</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"78a871e1-47a8-4214-98a9-ead0b01ac07c\">The Policy which formed the basis for Niramax's claim (the contractor's plant policy) originally incepted in 2006, with SWS as the insured. Niramax was added as an insured in 2007/08. The Policy provided all risks cover for loss or damage to owned and hired-in mobile plant. The Policy was renewed with Zurich on broadly similar terms in subsequent years, up to and including the 2014/15 policy year. For 2014/15, the premium was £23,714.40 - an increase of 20% on the previous year. The premium was, despite this increase, below what should have been offered due to the use of an incorrect multiplier.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"161978e8-6cca-43ad-a244-dba04cc7fb0d\">In mid-2015, mindful of the arrival of the Eggersmann plant, Niramax (through Mr Sweeney) requested that Zurich add the Eggersmann plant to the Policy. Initially, Zurich refused to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant as it was fixed plant, and the Policy only covered mobile plant. It was suggested that the new machinery should instead be covered under Niramax's property policy. Mr Sweeney persisted, and eventually Zurich agreed to cover the Eggersmann plant until the date of renewal of the Policy in December 2015 - subject to conditions including:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f86373ae-5b11-417c-a2b5-49846a595e07\">An increase in the excess under the Policy from £500 to £10,000.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7776e1b8-66c9-4a5d-bdd8-01f46f41cc3c\">A \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6c66ea07-2ad0-4520-aea6-12b954d7d6b7\">trouble free running in period</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"87c8b7a8-da95-4261-bb2a-ebaab0ce27c1\">\" of 30 days.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"23d8080d-4ef3-40dc-bc87-c5666d8de9eb\">An increased premium of £32,782.62.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c70df788-4fa3-45d1-8a8f-7ba674aa843b\">The fire occurred prior to renewal on 4 December 2015, and on renewal, Zurich declined to cover Niramax's fixed plant under the Policy.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"22a38f51-a834-4526-8094-79f1c166ddbc\">Niramax's Case, and Zurich's Defence</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"e500ec33-d450-4817-a637-c19a47f1a7ec\">Throughout, Niramax argued that it was entitled to an indemnity under the Policy. This included an indemnity for the loss of the Eggersmann plant, which was covered under the Policy at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"803c45c1-2cd3-4584-9d23-21be7024a527\">By contrast, although Zurich consistently maintained that it was entitled to avoid the Policy, the reasons it advanced at the time of avoidance substantially differed from those relied on at trial. At the time of avoidance, Zurich put its case as follows [125]-[130]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"69f3e28d-8ae7-440f-a440-ce988c8fe63c\">It contended that Niramax had failed to disclose five material circumstances. In particular, Zurich advanced the \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b1a4df41-aa1b-4b6c-817e-87ccdb11fc06\">\": an allegation that Mr Shaun Morfitt, who had been imprisoned for a serious criminal offence in 2010, was a shadow director of Niramax; and that his conviction should therefore have been disclosed to Zurich.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"96270a38-7783-4829-9ed2-48cf9868552a\">Zurich asserted that Niramax was in breach of conditions precedent under the Policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"dcd67c4e-affc-431c-b9df-8ce16f1a19a8\">Zurich later dropped the Morfitt Defence, and the breach of conditions defence.

On this basis, Zurich sought to avoid its obligations to indemnify Niramax, in whole or in part.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"9305abf2-6b0b-44ba-a795-b4e832b192d3\">Applicable legal principles</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"58e531a6-99c3-4792-aa5c-046799239a52\">It is for the party pleading non-disclosure (here, Zurich) to show that the relevant matter was \"material\" to the decision to write the risk. The Marine Insurance Act 1906 (\" the 1906 Act \") states that an insured must \" disclose to the insurer, before the contract is concluded, every material circumstance which is known to the assured, and the assured is deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known to him \" (s 18). A fact is material if it would \" influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in fixing the premium, or determining whether he will take the risk \" (s 18(2)).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"abf2f25d-db48-4492-b70f-3a1ffb803a05\">The judgment cited a number of further principles relevant to materiality, relying on the decisions of Carr J in Brit UW Ltd v F & B Trenchless Solutions Ltd [2016] Lloyd's Rep IR 69, and Leggatt J in Involnert Management v Aprilgrange Ltd [2015] 2 Lloyd's Rep 289 [133.iii]. These include the need for courts to take an objective approach to assessing materiality, based on the judge's independent appraisal of the alleged material circumstance in light of the facts at hand. Expert evidence is \" helpful and important to ensure that the court's findings are grounded in commercial reality \", but it is ultimately for the court to decide whether it is rational to take any particular matter into account.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"4f946623-ba27-4fa6-9e13-0792ca0fadef\">Second to materiality, Zurich had to show that any non-disclosure or misrepresentation relied on induced it to write the contract which was in fact written, on a \"but for\" basis [133.iv]. In the words of Clarke LJ in Assicurazioni Generali SpA v Arab Insurance Group [2003] 2 CLC 242 at [62]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"dbdef556-dd77-4119-803c-dbe6e17a942f\">In order to prove inducement the insurer or reinsurer must show that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was an effective cause of his entering into the contract on the terms on which he did. He must therefore show at least that, but for the relevant non-disclosure or misrepresentation, he would not have entered into the contract on those terms. On the other hand, he does not have to show that it was the sole effective cause of his doing so.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3be47a56-7c8c-447d-831b-84e9a77cc2de\">The burden for proving inducement is \" not a heavy one \" [134]. But the judge acknowledged that caution had to be exercised given that (1) avoidance is a draconian remedy which should not be lightly granted and (2) genuine evidence on inducement could nevertheless be inaccurate due to the effects of hindsight and party interest, and the difficulty of examining hypotheticals. The latter proved especially relevant given the shift in Zurich's case prior to trial.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"da7a2ea7-f809-4e05-828b-5503e46c61a7\">Zurich's Primary Defence: Risk Requirements and Special Terms</h3>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"a13dd6dd-6b9f-4652-9390-a362c437af7a\">Materiality</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"4a46b9d9-0f00-4fb5-8bf6-4f6701a0032d\">In relation to the risk requirements/special terms defence, both parties advanced expert evidence on the issue of materiality. The experts (broadly speaking) agreed that Niramax's non-compliance with risk requirements under the buildings policy, and the imposition of special terms by Millennium, were material. Those facts shone a light on Niramax's attitude to risk management, and demonstrated \" poor housekeeping \" [158]. The judge rejected an argument by Niramax that it was \" actively engaged in compliance \" during the course of 2014 - noting its \" lackadaisical \" approach to sourcing a suitable fire suppression system [141].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"e712ad5e-f830-433c-8eff-025e2832baeb\">Inducement</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"f1289451-5515-4b2c-8520-432944043e59\">The question of inducement was more complex. It raised three key preliminary issues: (1) the identity of the underwriter (2) the effect of any extra information provided if fuller disclosure had been made, and (3) the nature of the underwriting process.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"b368600e-b76c-4250-9928-2fce3a8d6ce7\">First, the court had to identify which member of Zurich's underwriting team would have made the final decision on whether to offer cover (in December 2014, and September 2015), had proper disclosure been made. The judge found - in accordance with the case advanced by Zurich - that the decision would have been referred up the chain to Mr Penny, the head of its engineering risks department. It followed that \" what Mr Penny would have done \" became the crucial question when considering inducement [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ea6404ce-8726-45c6-af29-6e9d5d40e4b8\">On the second issue, the judge accepted an argument advanced by Niramax that any findings on inducement should also account for the effect on underwriters of positive information about Niramax's business practices, which would have come out if fuller disclosure had been made. However, this argument cut both ways. If a full underwriting assessment had been given, it may also have brought into play \" some less attractive features \" [192]. In the round, the judge found that a fuller presentation would not have had much effect on the overall balance of the underwriting decision.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91c5ae09-35d1-425e-8df4-29a6497e56b0\">On the third issue, the judge rejected Niramax's case that even if proper disclosure had been made, it would not have had any impact on the underwriting process [195]. Niramax based its submission on the fact that Zurich had treated the mobile plant policy in a \" commoditised and streamlined \" way [25]. There was no proposal form, and Zurich calculated premiums based only on sums insured, trade and claims experience. Niramax argued that Zurich would have done the same at the time of the 2014 renewal, even if proper disclosure had been made; but the judge found this position unpersuasive. Had proper disclosure been made, the usual process for \" vanilla \" risks would not have been followed, and underwriters would have undertaken a more detailed analysis [200].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"66b9e6e2-5740-47a4-8df9-2e8de506cfbe\">Findings</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"993be1c2-5833-4241-8c38-53b2836039ae\">That left the ultimate question - what would Mr Penny have done, if presented with the new information? The conclusion: \" it is more likely than not that if he had been aware of the facts in question Mr Penny would have reluctantly offered renewal terms in December 2014 but would have refused the extension to cover the Eggersmann plant in September 2015 \" [201].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"2f588f32-2a1f-4f28-befd-61cc7f76d4d7\">A critical factor in Mr Penny's deliberations both in 2014 and in 2015 was the undesirability of recycling risks. In the years prior to 2013, the waste and recycling industry had come to be seen as a hazard for insurers, particularly due to fire losses [202]. In mid-2013, Mr Penny had instructed his underwriting team to stop covering fixed plant waste risks on engineering contractor's plant policies, and a 10% rate increase was subsequently levied on such risks [204]. By late 2014, the judge found that Zurich had effectively stopped writing new policies for waste risks, and was \" kicking…out \" much of its existing waste business [205]. This hostility to waste risks continued as time went on, and by the time the Eggersmann plant was added in late 2015, Mr Penny's attitude would have been even more adverse than it was at the time of renewal in December 2014 [217].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"12247f28-c3f9-4124-9247-a73672e5fa61\">In December 2014, Mr Penny would still have written the Policy - though with a higher premium to reflect the correct multiplier. This would have been done out of a sense of \" fair play \", and given the \" less than striking \" nature of the extra information which should have been disclosed [212]. On this basis, the judge found that the test for inducement was not satisfied. This was despite the factual finding that if proper disclosure had been made, the Policy would only have been written on different terms (applying the correct multiplier).</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8ff97bbf-c573-4dd3-87f4-e700e5327ca3\">However, Mr Penny would not have agreed to extend the Policy to cover the Eggersmann risk in 2015. As the judge found: \" By September 2015 the thinking in Zurich had moved further along the timeline of hostility to waste risks. So, the backdrop on this aspect would be no better for Niramax than it was as at December 2014, but rather worse. And at this stage we hypothesise that Mr Penny is presented with a fixed plant risk of considerable size which has no place in the mobile plant policy - as Mr Penny himself had made clear to his team in July 2013 - together with these facts relating to the risk requirements and special terms.\" [217]</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"f0ecfd05-c712-41f0-8739-41e8276c364c\">When the Eggersmann plant extension was written in, after coaxing by Mr Sweeney, it was a marginal decision even without further disclosure. Had proper disclosure been given, three factors would have carried the decision \" from a very reluctant write to a polite but firm refusal \" [220]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3d5efa3e-2f5f-40c0-8dee-e12d45dbb2bd\">The impact of the information disclosed. The Eggersmann machine was a substantial item of fixed plant, which was to be underwritten without a survey. Fixed plant was inherently at greater risk than mobile plant due to its lack of mobility. Questions over Niramax's risk management in the recent past would have been enough to tip the decision into a refusal for any of Zurich's underwriters [220].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"38c9b9fe-6308-4a26-9d27-3fe50ca58f11\">Mr Penny personally was highly sensitive to the \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"de38ee24-ad87-4e01-b419-02c36d1a7b99\">direction of travel</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"51e6d1e4-87b2-43b1-8213-e0e24e1589f8\">\" in relation to waste risks [221]. He had himself set a rule that there was to be no fixed plant on waste risks, and there was no reason to think that Mr Penny would have broken his own rule in the case of Niramax.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9e9ba03b-0b0d-4eeb-be0f-22010c23a1d2\">Mr Penny came across as a \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"dc855aca-a99d-4fc7-91c8-ccc8b57b646c\">\" when giving evidence, who would have been even less willing to accommodate the client than other underwriters in Zurich's team [223]. That included Mr Hutchinson, a senior underwriter in the engineering team, who took the decision in September 2015 to extend cover to the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"d1f1d8aa-48e5-4b2e-9ab0-2ce0ef2c616c\">Zurich's other defences</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"7de4ec19-3d2d-4372-b4c7-e7bbaeda616a\">Given those findings, the Millennium Renewal Terms and the Aspen Defence fell away, as they only related to the 2015 extension. In any event, they would have had little or no effect on inducing Mr Penny in the circumstances of the case [228]-[230].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"87dec588-532b-45dd-9b1d-1a079a7ac7de\">On the remaining defences advanced:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e92b434d-31ff-462c-832a-8dc5367e7aff\">The Sweeney Representation Defence was unpersuasive. There was no evidence that Niramax was aware of the representations being made by Mr Sweeney, and those representations were pieces of \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5b81b57c-9dc1-4591-93e7-9e6b8a90f092\">The 2012 Fire Defence did not succeed. Its materiality was doubtful: the fire was small and at a site which was not owned, operated or insured by Niramax. In any event, Mr Penny's evidence did not suggest that it would have met the inducement hurdle [235]-[236].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"bef78c50-414d-47ba-8277-c3c4e46bccf4\">The 2006 Fine Defence was also unlikely to be material, due to the lapse of time, and the fact that it related to a different company and location - as well as given subsequent changes in management. Even if material, it would not (together or in combination with the other defences) have induced Mr Penny to refuse to write the risk or to write it on different terms [237]-[238].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fdb973d9-d000-4d2a-a4c9-c3cabd8f1848\">The Dean Fine Defence also did not meet the threshold of inducement. The conviction had been spent for over 6 months at the time of renewal, and Mr Dean was not a director of Niramax at the time of the fine or of renewal [239].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c64e68ea-1ffb-456c-8795-70b8b99e9c91\">The final point as to non-disclosure of Niramax's breach of duty for failing to disclose material facts on earlier renewals also failed. There was no evidence to show that Niramax knew that it had previously failed to disclose material circumstances - and given the above, it would also have failed on the facts [240].</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"c2888d3e-3319-44d4-9c50-fdd733408385\">Quantum</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"d5d52ab5-2422-4fc4-9498-6ad83fac6390\">Zurich was ordered to return the premium received for the September extension (£32,782.62), and no indemnity was due for the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6805f11d-f0b2-4a1b-8621-f9c546b2aa4d\">Otherwise, the Policy stood, and Zurich was bound to indemnify Niramax for the items of mobile plant which were covered by the original Policy (as renewed in 2014) and damaged in the fire: two Liebherr excavators, and a Liebherr material handler. According to the Policy wording, Zurich was to pay \" the market value of the item at the time of the loss or damage \", and Zurich's internal guidance was that this meant \" the cost of a replacement item of similar age and condition \" [246].</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"74084008-3785-4cc5-8747-69da999970eb\">The judge preferred the (higher) valuations of Niramax's expert (Mr Correa) of £126,000 and £127,500 for the two excavators, and £167,750 for the material handler. In part, this was due to Mr Correa's greater relevant expertise in loss adjusting, by comparison with the expert instructed by Zurich, Professor Sheldon. The judge also preferred Mr Correa's methodology [255]-[263]:</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"6b71f3f5-45ef-4376-9972-d4d8f4873f0f\">The Sheldon valuations extrapolated from a single quoted price for each of the machines in 2019. These quotes were selected from a broader range of quoted prices, some of which were higher than those given in evidence.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9f5d9634-a22c-4444-a28d-ca63d836664d\">The Sheldon valuations took into account only foreign sales (there was no UK market for the plant), but failed to account for the cost of purchasing replacement plant in England - including transport costs, insurance and permits.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"88591453-8c9b-44e3-8118-4c8a4a30bf66\">The Sheldon calculations depreciated the items of plant (including the essentially identical excavators) at different rates for no discernible reason. The Correa valuation used the same 2.5% annual rate across each item, and this approach was deemed more credible in light of Mr Correa's expertise.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91a7c1d2-f853-462f-b230-e121a2455951\">The Correa figures cross-checked well against other reference figures - including those given by Zurich's loss adjusters Crawfords, and figures based on a 2019 valuation from Liebherr, discounted back to 2015.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e2278542-43e2-408a-b4ba-db27dfe76aa8\">Although it was not necessary given her findings on liability, the judge also preferred Niramax's valuation of the Eggersmann plant (£4,308,582) to Zurich's (£3,765,828) [249]-[254]. The machine was effectively brand new, and it was therefore appropriate to take the indemnity value as being the cost of a new replacement machine (in accordance with a subsequent quotation provided by Eggersmann).</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"ab7d824c-857d-4844-95b5-977cd92f69e1\">Comment</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"b0e500e3-e3cd-481c-baeb-4ad850f94bf9\">Non-disclosure cases turn, to a large extent, on their particular facts. But the decision in Niramax is a helpful illustration of how courts approach and apply the rules on material non-disclosure under the 1906 Act - in particular, in relation to the vexed issue of hypotheticals. Similar considerations are likely to apply to cases falling under the new provisions in Part 2 of the Insurance Act 2015.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"fcafccca-563f-48dc-941c-e12349d670c4\">One contentious element of the judge's reasoning relates to her finding that the \"original\" Policy stood - even though it would not have been written on the same terms if proper disclosure had been made (because Mr Penny would have accounted for the correct multiplier as part of the premium). The judge refused permission to appeal on this ground, but her findings on inducement raise interesting questions about how the test should be applied in circumstances where the policy would in fact have only been written on different terms.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"a9bcb73d-cbe6-456e-9018-2c762f70166b\">This article and the other articles in the series are not to be relied on as legal advice.

The mobile plant it used was covered by the Appellant (\"Zurich\") under a policy of insurance renewed on 14 December 2014 (\"the Policy\"). The risk was underwritten by a junior employee at Zurich, applying a \" commoditised and streamlined \" process that had only three inputs into a calculation of premium, namely the amount of the cover, the nature of the trade, and the claims experience. When entering these variables, instead of categorising the risk trade as waste, with an automatic premium of 6%, it was categorised by the junior employee as contractor's portable plant, with a premium of 2.25%, to which a loading of 40% was applied. Further the excess of £500 was very low for a risk of this type. On 5 September 2015, a fixed shredding machine, known as the Eggersmann plant and valued at £4.2m, was added to the Policy, increasing the overall plant cover to just over £5m.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c42f936b-a975-490b-84cf-29dc664be4b9\">On the night of 4 December 2015 a fire broke out at Niramax's main premises. The fire destroyed a number of items of mobile plant and the Eggersmann plant. Zurich declined the claim on the grounds of non-disclosure of material facts at the renewal in December 2014, and separately when the Eggersmann plant was added to the Policy in September 2015. In particular, it said Niramax had failed to disclose that it had not complied with a number of risk requirements which had been imposed by its property insurer, Millennium Insurance, and that this had resulted in Millennium imposing special terms requiring Niramax to self-insure for 35 per cent of any loss and in any event to bear the first £250,000 of any loss.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91d90d1a-d8bf-475f-be1e-776653e33ec0\">Zurich alleged that it was entitled to avoid the Policy from renewal on 14 December 2014; or in the alternative that it was entitled to avoid the extension of the Policy when the Eggersmann plant was added. Zurich further alleged that if the non-disclosed facts had been disclosed in September 2015 it would have cancelled the Policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3d9aecc2-8708-48e9-9651-7db0bd6200d2\">At first instance, Cockerill J held that there had been a material non-disclosure of Millennium's risk requirements and special terms and that had proper disclosure been made the risk would have been referred to a more senior underwriter within Zurich, Mr Penny. However, after hearing evidence from Mr Penny the Judge concluded that although he would have thought long and hard about whether to refuse renewal, he would not have done so. She accepted that had the material facts been disclosed at the time of the extension of the Policy to add the Eggersmann plant, Zurich would have declined to insure the Eggersmann plant, but found it still would not have cancelled the Policy. Accordingly, Niramax's claim succeeded in part, namely for recovery of the value of the mobile plant, but not the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7aa9d660-3f75-47b3-bce5-19ef941fdcd6\">In reaching the conclusion she did in relation to the 2014 renewal, Cockerill J noted that it was not in issue that the premium charged by Zurich was incorrectly calculated because of the junior underwriter's error which \" self-evidently left the premium below the level it would have been \" had an automatic premium of 6% been used. Moreover, she accepted that had Niramax made proper disclosure on renewal in 2014, Mr Penny would have corrected this error: he would have renewed the Policy, but only at the correct price for the risk. Such a difference in terms, however, would not have related to the relevant non-disclosed fact, but only to an earlier error by Zurich's employee, meaning the non-disclosure would not have been causative of the different terms. Accordingly, the effect of the Judge's ruling was the inducement was not made out even though the Policy would have been written on different terms 'but for' Niramax's non-disclosure.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"90c4113b-b0ab-4c81-a912-7dd030e6b2f3\">THE APPEAL AND RESPONDENT'S NOTICE</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"1f028ff7-c0cd-40f8-8d50-954c43d4f3a6\">Zurich appealed, arguing, among other things, that the judge erred on the issue of inducement. It contended that inducement was established as a matter of law, because the premium would have been higher had the disclosure been made; and that this was sufficient to meet the causation test for inducement irrespective of the amount of the increase or the thought process by which the additional premium would have been calculated.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"4d9cf162-a398-4add-ae82-fd6c6aea4216\">Niramax resisted the appeal and also filed a Respondent's Notice in which it maintained that the judge had fallen into error in saying that using a figure of 2.25% and then adding a weighting of 40% would \" self-evidently \" have left the premium below that which would have been reached if 6% had been applied. In fact, it said, there was no proper evidential basis for the judge to conclude that if Mr Penny had corrected the error in the approach in 2014 it would have resulted in a higher premium than had in fact been charged. That was not self-evident. Accordingly, it could not even be said that but for the non-disclosure the Policy would have been written on different terms, even as to premium.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"6008a1c9-1949-4bba-8813-73bccc7cfc6b\">THE COURT OF APPEAL'S JUDGMENT</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"e5ff8a24-6134-4ade-a27e-493b67b549b5\">The Court of Appeal, Popplewell LJ giving its judgment, dismissed Zurich's appeal.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"08877744-7dcf-4b4a-a588-ab9beabf2a75\">It accepted that although the way the evidence and argument had been presented at first instance had avoided real focus upon it, the point in Niramax's Respondent's Notice was well-founded, and that this alone was a reason the judgment should be upheld. Perhaps itself conscious this was so, at the appeal hearing Zurich did not press its legal argument that 'but for' causation was sufficient to make out inducement, but rather sought to argue, unsuccessfully, that properly understood, the judge had in fact made findings that Mr Penny would have charged additional premium not, or not only, to correct the \"mistake\", but also to reflect the increased risk which the undisclosed facts would have revealed. If this were so, Zurich said, the causation test for inducement would be met even if it was necessary for the non-disclosure to be an efficient cause. The Court of Appeal rejected this line of argument on the basis that (i) there was no permission to pursue it, and (ii) on a fair reading of the judgment it was clear that Cockerill J had held that the only difference of approach which Mr Penny would have adopted would have been to increase the premium to correct the junior underwriter's error; and that any increase would not have been related to the non-disclosed fact.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e96f9426-ac7c-4f3b-a1cd-592e63d16fcc\">Nevertheless, as Zurich had not abandoned its contention that 'but for' causation was sufficient, the Court dealt with it, even though it had been \" dismissed from the forefront of Zurich's] argument to a point at which it was barely visible in the rear view mirror. \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8e9f381d-cc3d-4fce-b1e8-aab87401a892\">It held that the judge had correctly applied the test for inducement: \" in order for non-disclosure to induce an underwriter to write the insurance on less onerous terms than would have been imposed if disclosure had been made, the non-disclosure must have been an efficient cause of the difference in terms. If that test of causation is not fulfilled, it is not sufficient merely to establish that the less onerous terms would not have been imposed but for the non-disclosure. \" (paragraph 30). Popplewell LJ stated that this conclusion was supported both by authority and principle.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ba0a53eb-21ea-4869-9b48-c9f4cf38209d\">As to authority (paragraphs 31 to 35):</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"04150d5e-faa5-4a23-8e3a-a197b3124696\">[1995] 1 AC 501 established the necessity to prove inducement in cases of both misrepresentation and non-disclosure, despite the absence of any such express requirement in sections 18 and 20 of the Marine Insurance Act of 1906. The speech of Lord Mustill equated the test for inducement with that applicable to misrepresentation in the common law generally. The rationale was that \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"0075942a-233a-433e-a2d6-4dad0629b5c4\">there had to be some effect which the undisclosed or misrepresented facts have on the mind of the underwriter</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"1b1dfaba-1c5b-4123-9e17-426b704e83ec\">The requirement in the general law of misrepresentation that there be such an effect on the mind of the representee has long been established. In</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5755b4ce-3d17-48c1-8ae3-2b7267b10c53\">(1885) 29 Ch D 459 it was held that the misrepresentation must be an effective cause, although not the sole cause, of the representee acting as did, in the sense that it must influence him in his decision and be part of the cause of what he did: see per Cotton LJ at p. 480-481, Bowen LJ at p. 483 and Fry LJ at p. 485.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"414a8a4b-2146-496b-afac-2a394578cf58\">, and said that this was no different from the expression Stephenson LJ had used in</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d337ee09-d2ce-456e-bd4d-9ab509656d96\">[1983] 1 All ER 583, 589b of \"a real and substantial\" cause</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3c45a6ae-bba3-44cd-b55d-ceb38d62c2a7\">In order to prove inducement the insurer or reinsurer must show that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was an effective cause of his entering into the contract on the terms on which he did. He must therefore show at least that, but for the relevant non-disclosure or misrepresentation, he would not have entered into the contract on those terms. On the other hand, he does not have to show that it was the sole effective cause of his doing so.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"1eee98b4-23a6-4ce3-a4c8-442a3f88e739\">\" However, he was not equiparating the two tests, as his use of \"at least\" demonstrated. In many cases if an insurer cannot satisfy the effective cause test he will also be unable to satisfy the but for test; but that is not always so, as the current case demonstrated.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c3b94cc8-4ec5-4fc3-adb7-da55fe14c90e\">As to principle, Popplewell LJ observed (at paragraph 36) that \" if a non-disclosure has not had any influential effect on the mind of the insurer, in the sense that if disclosed it would not have played any part in his underwriting judgment, there is no connection at all between the wrongdoing of the assured and the terms on which the insurance is written by the insurer. It is difficult to see any justification for affording the insurer a windfall remedy in such circumstances. \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"53efa1e5-1d21-48fc-9f1b-935f224dbb50\">To satisfy the requirement for inducement, it was therefore necessary for the non-disclosure to be an \" efficient cause \" of the fact that different terms were not offered, not merely a but for cause. The expression \"efficient cause\", rather than \"effective cause\" was appropriate because it reflected the language used in Financial Conduct Authority v Arch Insurance (UK) Ltd [2021] UKSC 1 to distinguish between a but for test and what was historically called a proximate cause, in characterising the causative link between the insured peril and the loss in insurance cases.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"48dca46d-f9dd-4de1-bf1b-8473b7561ba6\">Applying the correct test for inducement to the Judge's findings, the Court held she was right to conclude that there was no inducement. An important feature of the case was that rating the risk for the purposes of calculating premium at Zurich took no account of attitude to risk, which was what the undisclosed facts went to, save to the extent that it was reflected in the claims experience which was independently one of the criteria taken into account. It was a formulaic streamlined process based only on the amount insured, nature of the trade and claims history (on the Judge's findings). Accordingly, Niramax's attitude to risk, and therefore the undisclosed facts, was irrelevant to the rating of the risk, save to the extent that they were reflected in the claims record. The non-disclosure cannot therefore have had any causative efficacy in the renewal being written on cheaper terms than would have occurred if disclosure had been made.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"adc0014b-5b44-4dee-a33b-ae38abd900e7\">Put another way, it was the mistake as to the calculation of the premium, not a failure by Niramax to disclose matters, which was the sole cause of the policy being written more cheaply than it would have been by Mr Penny.

It is not sufficient merely to establish that the less onerous terms would not have been imposed 'but for' the non-disclosure.

The mobile plant it used was covered by the Appellant (\"Zurich\") under a policy of insurance renewed on 14 December 2014 (\"the Policy\"). The risk was underwritten by a junior employee at Zurich, applying a \" commoditised and streamlined \" process that had only three inputs into a calculation of premium, namely the amount of the cover, the nature of the trade, and the claims experience. When entering these variables, instead of categorising the risk trade as waste, with an automatic premium of 6%, it was categorised by the junior employee as contractor's portable plant, with a premium of 2.25%, to which a loading of 40% was applied. Further the excess of £500 was very low for a risk of this type. On 5 September 2015, a fixed shredding machine, known as the Eggersmann plant and valued at £4.2m, was added to the Policy, increasing the overall plant cover to just over £5m.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c42f936b-a975-490b-84cf-29dc664be4b9\">On the night of 4 December 2015 a fire broke out at Niramax's main premises. The fire destroyed a number of items of mobile plant and the Eggersmann plant. Zurich declined the claim on the grounds of non-disclosure of material facts at the renewal in December 2014, and separately when the Eggersmann plant was added to the Policy in September 2015. In particular, it said Niramax had failed to disclose that it had not complied with a number of risk requirements which had been imposed by its property insurer, Millennium Insurance, and that this had resulted in Millennium imposing special terms requiring Niramax to self-insure for 35 per cent of any loss and in any event to bear the first £250,000 of any loss.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"91d90d1a-d8bf-475f-be1e-776653e33ec0\">Zurich alleged that it was entitled to avoid the Policy from renewal on 14 December 2014; or in the alternative that it was entitled to avoid the extension of the Policy when the Eggersmann plant was added. Zurich further alleged that if the non-disclosed facts had been disclosed in September 2015 it would have cancelled the Policy.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3d9aecc2-8708-48e9-9651-7db0bd6200d2\">At first instance, Cockerill J held that there had been a material non-disclosure of Millennium's risk requirements and special terms and that had proper disclosure been made the risk would have been referred to a more senior underwriter within Zurich, Mr Penny. However, after hearing evidence from Mr Penny the Judge concluded that although he would have thought long and hard about whether to refuse renewal, he would not have done so. She accepted that had the material facts been disclosed at the time of the extension of the Policy to add the Eggersmann plant, Zurich would have declined to insure the Eggersmann plant, but found it still would not have cancelled the Policy. Accordingly, Niramax's claim succeeded in part, namely for recovery of the value of the mobile plant, but not the Eggersmann plant.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"7aa9d660-3f75-47b3-bce5-19ef941fdcd6\">In reaching the conclusion she did in relation to the 2014 renewal, Cockerill J noted that it was not in issue that the premium charged by Zurich was incorrectly calculated because of the junior underwriter's error which \" self-evidently left the premium below the level it would have been \" had an automatic premium of 6% been used. Moreover, she accepted that had Niramax made proper disclosure on renewal in 2014, Mr Penny would have corrected this error: he would have renewed the Policy, but only at the correct price for the risk. Such a difference in terms, however, would not have related to the relevant non-disclosed fact, but only to an earlier error by Zurich's employee, meaning the non-disclosure would not have been causative of the different terms. Accordingly, the effect of the Judge's ruling was the inducement was not made out even though the Policy would have been written on different terms 'but for' Niramax's non-disclosure.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"90c4113b-b0ab-4c81-a912-7dd030e6b2f3\">THE APPEAL AND RESPONDENT'S NOTICE</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"1f028ff7-c0cd-40f8-8d50-954c43d4f3a6\">Zurich appealed, arguing, among other things, that the judge erred on the issue of inducement. It contended that inducement was established as a matter of law, because the premium would have been higher had the disclosure been made; and that this was sufficient to meet the causation test for inducement irrespective of the amount of the increase or the thought process by which the additional premium would have been calculated.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"4d9cf162-a398-4add-ae82-fd6c6aea4216\">Niramax resisted the appeal and also filed a Respondent's Notice in which it maintained that the judge had fallen into error in saying that using a figure of 2.25% and then adding a weighting of 40% would \" self-evidently \" have left the premium below that which would have been reached if 6% had been applied. In fact, it said, there was no proper evidential basis for the judge to conclude that if Mr Penny had corrected the error in the approach in 2014 it would have resulted in a higher premium than had in fact been charged. That was not self-evident. Accordingly, it could not even be said that but for the non-disclosure the Policy would have been written on different terms, even as to premium.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"6008a1c9-1949-4bba-8813-73bccc7cfc6b\">THE COURT OF APPEAL'S JUDGMENT</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"e5ff8a24-6134-4ade-a27e-493b67b549b5\">The Court of Appeal, Popplewell LJ giving its judgment, dismissed Zurich's appeal.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"08877744-7dcf-4b4a-a588-ab9beabf2a75\">It accepted that although the way the evidence and argument had been presented at first instance had avoided real focus upon it, the point in Niramax's Respondent's Notice was well-founded, and that this alone was a reason the judgment should be upheld. Perhaps itself conscious this was so, at the appeal hearing Zurich did not press its legal argument that 'but for' causation was sufficient to make out inducement, but rather sought to argue, unsuccessfully, that properly understood, the judge had in fact made findings that Mr Penny would have charged additional premium not, or not only, to correct the \"mistake\", but also to reflect the increased risk which the undisclosed facts would have revealed. If this were so, Zurich said, the causation test for inducement would be met even if it was necessary for the non-disclosure to be an efficient cause. The Court of Appeal rejected this line of argument on the basis that (i) there was no permission to pursue it, and (ii) on a fair reading of the judgment it was clear that Cockerill J had held that the only difference of approach which Mr Penny would have adopted would have been to increase the premium to correct the junior underwriter's error; and that any increase would not have been related to the non-disclosed fact.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"e96f9426-ac7c-4f3b-a1cd-592e63d16fcc\">Nevertheless, as Zurich had not abandoned its contention that 'but for' causation was sufficient, the Court dealt with it, even though it had been \" dismissed from the forefront of Zurich's] argument to a point at which it was barely visible in the rear view mirror. \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"8e9f381d-cc3d-4fce-b1e8-aab87401a892\">It held that the judge had correctly applied the test for inducement: \" in order for non-disclosure to induce an underwriter to write the insurance on less onerous terms than would have been imposed if disclosure had been made, the non-disclosure must have been an efficient cause of the difference in terms. If that test of causation is not fulfilled, it is not sufficient merely to establish that the less onerous terms would not have been imposed but for the non-disclosure. \" (paragraph 30). Popplewell LJ stated that this conclusion was supported both by authority and principle.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"ba0a53eb-21ea-4869-9b48-c9f4cf38209d\">As to authority (paragraphs 31 to 35):</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"04150d5e-faa5-4a23-8e3a-a197b3124696\">[1995] 1 AC 501 established the necessity to prove inducement in cases of both misrepresentation and non-disclosure, despite the absence of any such express requirement in sections 18 and 20 of the Marine Insurance Act of 1906. The speech of Lord Mustill equated the test for inducement with that applicable to misrepresentation in the common law generally. The rationale was that \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"0075942a-233a-433e-a2d6-4dad0629b5c4\">there had to be some effect which the undisclosed or misrepresented facts have on the mind of the underwriter</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"1b1dfaba-1c5b-4123-9e17-426b704e83ec\">The requirement in the general law of misrepresentation that there be such an effect on the mind of the representee has long been established. In</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"5755b4ce-3d17-48c1-8ae3-2b7267b10c53\">(1885) 29 Ch D 459 it was held that the misrepresentation must be an effective cause, although not the sole cause, of the representee acting as did, in the sense that it must influence him in his decision and be part of the cause of what he did: see per Cotton LJ at p. 480-481, Bowen LJ at p. 483 and Fry LJ at p. 485.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"414a8a4b-2146-496b-afac-2a394578cf58\">, and said that this was no different from the expression Stephenson LJ had used in</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d337ee09-d2ce-456e-bd4d-9ab509656d96\">[1983] 1 All ER 583, 589b of \"a real and substantial\" cause</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"3c45a6ae-bba3-44cd-b55d-ceb38d62c2a7\">In order to prove inducement the insurer or reinsurer must show that the non-disclosure or misrepresentation was an effective cause of his entering into the contract on the terms on which he did. He must therefore show at least that, but for the relevant non-disclosure or misrepresentation, he would not have entered into the contract on those terms. On the other hand, he does not have to show that it was the sole effective cause of his doing so.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"1eee98b4-23a6-4ce3-a4c8-442a3f88e739\">\" However, he was not equiparating the two tests, as his use of \"at least\" demonstrated. In many cases if an insurer cannot satisfy the effective cause test he will also be unable to satisfy the but for test; but that is not always so, as the current case demonstrated.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c3b94cc8-4ec5-4fc3-adb7-da55fe14c90e\">As to principle, Popplewell LJ observed (at paragraph 36) that \" if a non-disclosure has not had any influential effect on the mind of the insurer, in the sense that if disclosed it would not have played any part in his underwriting judgment, there is no connection at all between the wrongdoing of the assured and the terms on which the insurance is written by the insurer. It is difficult to see any justification for affording the insurer a windfall remedy in such circumstances. \"</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"53efa1e5-1d21-48fc-9f1b-935f224dbb50\">To satisfy the requirement for inducement, it was therefore necessary for the non-disclosure to be an \" efficient cause \" of the fact that different terms were not offered, not merely a but for cause. The expression \"efficient cause\", rather than \"effective cause\" was appropriate because it reflected the language used in Financial Conduct Authority v Arch Insurance (UK) Ltd [2021] UKSC 1 to distinguish between a but for test and what was historically called a proximate cause, in characterising the causative link between the insured peril and the loss in insurance cases.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"48dca46d-f9dd-4de1-bf1b-8473b7561ba6\">Applying the correct test for inducement to the Judge's findings, the Court held she was right to conclude that there was no inducement. An important feature of the case was that rating the risk for the purposes of calculating premium at Zurich took no account of attitude to risk, which was what the undisclosed facts went to, save to the extent that it was reflected in the claims experience which was independently one of the criteria taken into account. It was a formulaic streamlined process based only on the amount insured, nature of the trade and claims history (on the Judge's findings). Accordingly, Niramax's attitude to risk, and therefore the undisclosed facts, was irrelevant to the rating of the risk, save to the extent that they were reflected in the claims record. The non-disclosure cannot therefore have had any causative efficacy in the renewal being written on cheaper terms than would have occurred if disclosure had been made.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"adc0014b-5b44-4dee-a33b-ae38abd900e7\">Put another way, it was the mistake as to the calculation of the premium, not a failure by Niramax to disclose matters, which was the sole cause of the policy being written more cheaply than it would have been by Mr Penny. The non-disclosure provided the opportunity the mistake on calculation which meant that the but for test of causation was fulfilled. But the mistake by the junior underwriter was the sole efficient cause of the policy being written more cheaply than it would otherwise have been priced by Zurich, through Mr Penny.</p>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"66f74f58-d631-4643-8f15-d3143d8609a2\">COMMENTARY</h3>\n<p data-text-id = \"5035691a-373e-4366-91ff-07f76554df18\">It is suggested that the decision is clearly correct and unsurprising.

Given that in Pan Atlantic the House of Lords felt able to imply a requirement of inducement into the Marine Insurance Act 1906, a Court today might equally feel able to construe the 2015 Act as requiring more than just 'but for' causation so as to avoid such an outcome.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"d1e265e0-e6fd-4480-b6fd-d50e949e1355\">Keywords: Inducement, Misrepresentation, Non-disclosure, Property Insurance</p>\n<figure class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"cf51dbb8-6d5b-413a-8c16-2ac63cdaa7f1\">\n\t<img src=https://www.4newsquare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/4ns-q-banner-1.jpg/>\n\t<figcaption>The Test for Inducement in Contracts Prior to the Insurance Act 2015: Zurich Insurance PLC v Niramax Group Limited [2021] EWCA Civ 590</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>","Date":{"Year":2021,"Month":5,"MonthShort":"May","Day":4},"SourceIds":["4eb3a73b-1feb-4c84-a5fc-0a15d9df8410","e4c060e1-92f7-430b-b65d-c22e96ce4505"]},{"FtaDoc":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n<div data-section-id = \"470a7cec-df97-4ba9-99bb-f8384afa3c4d\">\n<h1 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"bc6816b4-84f4-4625-b4a4-c9dc03a32637\">News in brief</h1>\n<h2 class= \"unordered\" data-text-id = \"f0ccd802-b6aa-4daf-a8f7-58acb4dd1f55\">With news on; Ealing Christmas tree returns; FCC launches charity reuse shop; Viridor donates to Sue Ryder; Niramax reaches SRF export milestone, and; MetalMatters unveils campaign for Welsh boroughs 'Plastic bottle' Christmas tree returns to Ealing A Christmas tree made entirely of recyclable plastic bottles has returned to Southall Square in the London borough … Read M...</h2>\n<h3 data-text-id = \"3c68846b-249c-4687-a4ab-fdd46fe87de0\">'Plastic bottle' Christmas tree returns to Ealing</h3>\n<h4 data-text-id = \"036e3730-5531-4fce-a74f-cf808a22bf95\">A Christmas tree made entirely of recyclable plastic bottles has returned to Southall Square in the London borough of Ealing, ahead of the festive holiday.</h4>\n<p data-text-id = \"e1248554-c3ec-4ca1-81e8-1f986ace4dbd\">The unique tree - designed by artist Ashley Phillips - is made of hundreds of bottles and forms part of the council's 50% by 2020 recycling campaign.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"152b69a3-6d22-4275-9060-cf557fa2d468\">This year the tree has been given a new look - with pink and purple bottles replacing the green bottles used to build the artwork in December 2013.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"c2740892-1273-4aeb-bea4-30d255fb512e\">Standing six metres high, it will be one of the main attractions at the upcoming Southall Christmas Market on Sunday 7 December.</p>\n<p data-text-id = \"9caf7444-8149-4050-9354-4559503b8b89\">Councillor Bassam Mahfouz, cabinet member for environment and transport said: \"Following the successful campaign last year, we wanted to reinvigorate the conversation about recycling.
